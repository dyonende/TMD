The present study was planned to assess the persistence of intestinal parasitosis in immigrants stably living in the urban central area of Naples (Southern Italy) and the spread of infection within households with a lifestyle similar to that of the country of origin. A total of 2150 stool samples were analysed with the FLOTAC dual technique, and 415 subjects (19.3 %) tested positive for pathogenic intestinal parasites. One hundred ninety-six subjects were randomly selected and monitored again after 1 year in order to evaluate the persistence of intestinal parasites in immigrants having access to proper sanitation. No pathogenic parasites were found in these 196 samples. A total of 482 cohabitants of 151 positive subjects were recruited to evaluate the interfamilial spread of the identified parasites. Only in 18 households were there subjects infected with the same parasite. Monitoring of parasites in stool samples of immigrants showed a decrease of almost all pathogenic species over the years. From the analysis of households, it is not possible to assert that there is a familial transmission. Our study provides evidence that the prevalence of parasitic infections in immigrants is likely related to the poor sanitary habits of the country of origin and that acquisition of new sanitary regulations, together with the administration of pharmacological treatment, limits the transmission in the households and in the local population of their destination.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Animals"",""Emigrants and Immigrants"",""Family Characteristics"",""Feces"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Intestinal Diseases, Parasitic"",""Italy"",""Male"",""Prevalence"",""Sanitation""]","[""Drug efficacy"",""FLOTAC"",""Household"",""Immigrants"",""Intestinal parasitosis"",""Sanitation""]",10.1007/s00436-015-4868-2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959115265,,0

Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Marine legislation, the key means by which the conservation of marine biodiversity is achieved, has been developing since the 1960s. In recent decades, an increasing focus on ‘holistic’ policy development is evident, compared with earlier ‘piecemeal’ sectoral approaches. Important marine legislative tools being used in the United Kingdom, and internationally, include the designation of marine protected areas and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) with its aim of meeting ‘Good Environmental Status’ (GES) for European seas by 2020. There is growing evidence of climate change impacts on marine biodiversity, which may compromise the effectiveness of any legislation intended to promote sustainable marine resource management. A review of key marine biodiversity legislation relevant to the UK shows climate change was not considered in the drafting of much early legislation. Despite the huge increase in knowledge of climate change impacts in recent decades, legislation is still limited in how it takes these impacts into account. There is scope, however, to account for climate change in implementing much of the legislation through (a) existing references to environmental variability; (b) review cycles; and (c) secondary legislation and complementary policy development. For legislation relating to marine protected areas (e.g. the EC Habitats and Birds Directives), climate change has generally not been considered in the site-designation process, or for ongoing management, with the exception of the Marine (Scotland) Act. Given that changing environmental conditions (e.g. rising temperatures and ocean acidification) directly affect the habitats and species that sites are designated for, how this legislation is used to protect marine biodiversity in a changing climate requires further consideration. Accounting for climate change impacts on marine biodiversity in the development and implementation of legislation is vital to enable timely, adaptive management responses. Marine modelling can play an important role in informing management decisions.

All rights reserved.Given large changes in working conditions and society, occupational health care has to prioritize its efforts towards fostering health and functioning of workers and as such promote work participation. This requires that more emphasis is given on the application of biopsychological models in the care of workers. Although a biopsychological approach is often mentioned as essential part of occupational health care, it's application is often hampered in practice, by practical barriers and lack of practical knowledge. This is illustrated by a study that uncovered facilitating and hindering factors in the implementation process of a preventive strategy, proven effective in reducing the risk of long term sickness absence. To facilitate the use of biopsychological models in occupational health care, it is shown that setting up a training curriculum is possible, based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) grafted on available training in evidence based practice skills is possible. Furthermore, there is a need for elaboration of the personal factors relevant for workers and the relevant work-related environmental factors to support practical application of ICF in occupational health care. A paradigm shift in occupational health care can facilitate widespread implementation of the biopsychosocial approach in occupational health and may stimulate occupational health professionals to further integrate this approach in their daily practice.","[""Health Promotion"",""Humans"",""International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health"",""Occupational Diseases"",""Occupational Health"",""Psychology""]",,10.3233/WOR-172549,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021779380,,0

All rights reserved.Aims: Conflicting data exist on the impact on outcome of the use of different stent types during carotid artery stenting (CAS). The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical outcomes according to different carotid stent design among the population of the European Registry of Carotid Artery Stenting (ERCAS). Methods and results: The present study was conducted in 1,604 patients who underwent neuroprotected CAS in ERCAS. All types of commercially available carotid stent were used. Open-cell design stents were classified according to free cell area into <7.5 mm2 or >7.5 mm2. A total of 713 closed-cell, 456 hybrid-cell, 238 <7.5 mm2 open-cell, and 197 >7.5 mm2 open-cell stents were implanted. Overall, the 30-day stroke and death rate was 1.37%. At 30 days, 19 strokes occurred (1.18%): eight in the group of patients treated with a closed-cell (1.12%), two in those with a hybrid-cell (0.44%), three in those with a <7.5 mm2 open-cell (1.26%), and six in those treated with a >7.5 mm2 open-cell stent (3.05%) (p=0.045). Conclusions: Data of the present study suggest that, in the setting of neuroprotected CAS performed in high-volume centres by properly trained operators, the use of an open-cell design stent with a free cell area >7.5 mm2 may be associated with an increased 30-day stroke risk.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Angioplasty"",""Carotid Artery Diseases"",""Carotid Stenosis"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Prosthesis Design"",""Registries"",""Risk Assessment"",""Risk Factors"",""Stents"",""Time Factors"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""Carotid arteries"",""Stents"",""Stroke""]",10.4244/EIJV12I2A41,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975859176,,0

Management of this sector relies on infrequent hydro-acoustic surveys, which provide measures of anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus and sardine Sardinops sagax biomass used in the assessments of stock status and in the development of management plans for the sustainable utilisation of these resources. We demonstrate how technological capabilities in ocean robotics at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) could augment the current resource-intensive hydro-acoustic ship-based survey programme and create opportunities for expanding its spatial and temporal resolution. We successfully implement and demonstrate an autonomous wave glider, fitted with a hydro-acoustic sensor and compare the data to a collocated ‘traditional’ ship-based acoustics survey. In the future these autonomous systems approaches could be seen as a means to lessen the cost burden of the ship-based survey, while at the same time with the added advantage of continuous collection over much wider spatial and temporal domains. This could enable a more reflexive stock management approach taking into account the seasonal characteristics of the fishery and its ecosystem. Gliders thus have potential to increase dramatically the quantity of information available to fisheries managers, thereby reducing uncertainty and contributing to improved management of valuable fish resources.

Knowledge on the fate of landfill leachate in tropical countries will be beneficial for monitoring and regulatory purposes. We studied the Keputih landfill close to the sea at Surabaya, Indonesia: (1) to assess leachate and groundwater hydrochemistry with respect to contamination and seawater intrusion, (2) to investigate the seasonal effects on hydrochemical composition; and (3) to determine redox conditions in order to evaluate the potential for natural attenuation through microbe-mediated electron-accepting processes. We document an influence from sea water intrusion on groundwater hydrochemistry on top of the influences from the landfill itself. Leachate had a high electrical conductivity and high COD, and contained high concentrations of NH4+, HCO3-, SO42-, Fe2+ and Cl-. Concentrations were significantly influenced by season, except for COD and SO42-. The groundwater at locations surrounding the landfill was also contaminated by leachate and concentrations of groundwater contaminants were higher than national regulatory standards in Indonesia for drinking water. The abundance of SO42- in groundwater indicates a large potential for anaerobic biodegradation of organic compounds. Based on the relative concentrations of Cl- and SO42- an influence of the sea water on groundwater hydrochemistry was obvious.

CC Attribution 3.0 License.The study of aerosols in the troposphere and in the stratosphere is of major importance both for climate and air quality studies. Among the numerous instruments available, optical aerosol particles counters (OPCs) provide the size distribution in diameter range from about 100 nm to a few tens of μm. Most of them are very sensitive to the nature of aerosols, and this can result in significant biases in the retrieved size distribution. We describe here a new versatile optical particle/sizer counter named LOAC (Light Optical Aerosol Counter), which is light and compact enough to perform measurements not only at the surface but under all kinds of balloons in the troposphere and in the stratosphere. LOAC is an original OPC performing observations at two scattering angles. The first one is around 12-, and is almost insensitive to the refractive index of the particles; the second one is around 60± and is strongly sensitive to the refractive index of the particles. By combining measurement at the two angles, it is possible to retrieve the size distribution between 0.2 and 100 μm and to estimate the nature of the dominant particles (droplets, carbonaceous, salts and mineral particles) when the aerosol is relatively homogeneous. This typology is based on calibration charts obtained in the laboratory. The uncertainty for total concentrations measurements is ±20% when concentrations are higher than 1 particle cm-3 (for a 10 min integration time). For lower concentrations, the uncertainty is up to about ±60% for concentrations smaller than 10-2 particle cm-3. Also, the uncertainties in size calibration are ±0.025 μm for particles smaller than 0.6 μm, 5% for particles in the 0.7-2 μm range, and 10% for particles greater than 2 μm. The measurement accuracy of submicronic particles could be reduced in a strongly turbid case when concentration of particles > 3 μm exceeds a few particles cm-3. Several campaigns of cross-comparison of LOAC with other particle counting instruments and remote sensing photometers have been conducted to validate both the size distribution derived by LOAC and the retrieved particle number density. The typology of the aerosols has been validated in well-defined conditions including urban pollution, desert dust episodes, sea spray, fog, and cloud. Comparison with reference aerosol mass monitoring instruments also shows that the LOAC measurements can be successfully converted to mass concentrations.",,,10.5194/amt-9-1721-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84965112358,https://www.atmos-meas-tech.net/9/1721/2016/amt-9-1721-2016.pdf,0

The focus on cost-effectiveness by spatial conservation prioritization has led to a bias towards placing MPAs in areas that are least threatened. This study investigates how conservation priorities differ between two management strategies of either targeting or avoiding high threat areas for protection, using the case of the Sulu Sulawesi Seas in the Coral Triangle. For both strategies, the target of protecting 20% of habitat could not be achieved solely by protecting low threat areas. A high proportion of the region had large differences in conservation outcomes between the two strategies; majority of these areas were highly prioritized in the threat avoidance strategy but had low or zero importance in the threat selection strategy. Selecting for highly threatened areas required less habitat area to be protected to achieve the same conservation target and resulted in a more equitable distribution of priority sites per country and sub-region. This demonstrates the importance of deciding on the objectives of conservation and management policies up-front. The results suggest that, contrary to the common practice of avoiding threats in spatial planning, a threat selection strategy should be part of the management toolbox, particularly in transboundary planning for regions with high overall threat levels, where it may be important to achieve shared conservation targets equitably.",,"[""Coral triangle"",""Marxan"",""Scenario analysis"",""Spatial conservation prioritization"",""Spatial planning"",""Threats""]",10.1016/j.marpol.2016.02.010,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958280084,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:380895/UQ380895_OA.pdf,0

The almost 50-fold increase in international tourism arrivals has substantial implications for environmental sustainability, but these have not yet been fully explored. This paper argues that a full exploration requires the study of tourism as a complex socio-ecological system. Such approach integrates environmental processes and stakeholder behaviour and puts feedbacks in the spotlight. Systemic insights can inform strategies to address tourism's problematic environmental performance. The paper finds that systems approaches in tourism research are rare and identifies a number of challenges: the large number of stakeholders involved; the heterogeneity of stakeholders; and the lack of transdisciplinarity in tourism research. The paper then argues that agent-based modelling can help address some of these challenges. Agent-based modelling allows to run simplified tourism systems with heterogeneous stakeholders and explore their behaviour, thus acting as living hypotheses. They do this by: (1) representing tourism's dynamics in a systemic, intuitive and individual-based way; (2) combining theories from different domains; (3) unpacking the link between stakeholder behaviours and emergent tourism system patterns; and (4) connecting researchers and stakeholders. Agent-based models allow representation of heterogeneous agents driven by plausible needs, who perceive local context and interact socially. Companion modelling is identified as a promising tool for more effective stakeholder inclusion.",,,10.1016/j.cosust.2016.11.015,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010465190,,0

Hence, mono- and di-substituted naphthalenediimides (NDIs) were designed to have different functional groups that provide to them both tunable optical properties and adjustable HOMO/LUMO levels, and were selectively prepared (starting from 1,4,5,8-naphthalenetetracarboxylic acid) achieving yields >69%. Smart anchoring groups (i.e. carboxylates or aromatic amines) were added to the dyes in order to allow them to covalently bond to acidic -OH groups present on the BiVO4 surface. An easy and low-cost room temperature dip-coating technique was used to dye-sensitize both BiVO4 powders and thin films. NMR, MS, FT-IR, TG, FESEM, XRD, XPS and optical analyses confirmed the successful organic synthetic routes and good dyes/BiVO4 linkages. Photochemical and photoelectrochemical water oxidation reaction tests, together with DFT calculations, demonstrated that a proper alignment of the semiconductor/NDI-based dye energy levels is fundamental for enhancing the photocatalyst performance through a Z-scheme mechanism. The ability of the NDI organic molecules to delocalize the electronic charges was also a key factor for minimizing recombination processes and achieving more than a ten-fold increase in the photocurrent density of a 6 cm2 BiVO4 photo-electrode.

Although treatment is covered by health insurance and is thus available for all patients at no cost, treatment refusal and treatment discontinuation have been observed. However, no data providing numbers and outcomes for developed countries have been published thus far. Procedure: A questionnaire-based survey was performed among German pediatric oncology centers to ascertain the number of treatment refusals among pediatric patients who were diagnosed between January 2008 and December 2009 in Germany. Results: Questionnaires from 70 of 73 centers were available, and of these 13 centers reported a total of 15 cases of treatment refusal or discontinuation within this 2-year period. Five of the 15 patients died, 7 of 15 were still alive, and the current status of 3 of 15 patients was unknown. Diseases were heterogeneous. Six of the 15 parents refused treatment for their children initially, 8 of 15 discontinued during the course of treatment. Five patients were treated after parental custody had been withdrawn due to the lack of compliance. All these five patients survived. Parents’ reasons given for refusal or discontinuation of treatment were related to personal health beliefs and coping strategies. Conclusions: Although treatment refusal or discontinuation is rare, it is accompanied by a high mortality rate.

The resulting increases in levels of international trade and investment have subsequently generated research interest into the potential population health impact. We present a systematic review of quantitative studies investigating the relationship between international trade, foreign direct investment and non-nutritional health outcomes. Articles were systematically collected from the SCOPUS, PubMed, EconLit and Web of Science databases. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the evidence considered, the 16 included articles were subdivided into individual level data analyses, selected country analyses and international panel analyses. Articles were then quality assessed using a tool developed as part of the project. Nine of the studies were assessed to be high quality, six as medium quality, and one as low quality. The evidence from the quantitative literature suggests that overall, there appears to be a beneficial association between international trade and population health. There was also evidence of the importance of foreign direct investment, yet a lack of research considering the direction of causality. Taken together, quantitative research into the relationship between trade and non-nutritional health indicates trade to be beneficial, yet this body of research is still in its infancy.

The aim of this study was to determine the number of patients who undergo liver resection due to HCC and to investigate outcomes after surgery at Landspitali University Hospital in Iceland. Material and methods: A retrospective study of all HCC patients, 18 years of age or older, who underwent surgical resection at Landspitali University Hospital from January 1st 1993 to December 31st 2012. Data was collected from clinical records. Descriptive statistical analysis was used. Results: During the time period 22 patients were operated with a liver resection and of those patients 12 (55%) had a major hepatectomy. 105 individuals in total were diagnosed with HCC in the time period, six patients had transplantation which results in 28 operations (27%). The average size of the tumors was 8.5 cm (3-22). Four individuals had cirrhosis. The frequency of intra-operative complications was 23% and post-operative complications 32% (Clavien-Dindo grade III and IV). A total of three individuals needed reoperation. The 30 day mortality rate was 0%. Twelve (55%) individuals were diagnosed with recurrence during the research period and eleven died. The one year mortality rate was 23%. Conclusion: The proportion of operable individuals with HCC in Iceland is low, few of whom have cirrhosis or other chronic liver disease. The mortality rate is comparable to other researches but the frequency of serious complications is higher probably due to tumor size.","[""Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"",""Hepatectomy"",""Hospitals, University"",""Humans"",""Iceland"",""Liver Neoplasms"",""Postoperative Complications"",""Reoperation"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Factors"",""Time Factors"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""HCC"",""Hepatocellular carcinoma"",""Liver surgery"",""Major hepatectomy""]",10.17992/lbl.2017.11.158,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034093425,https://www.laeknabladid.is/media/tolublod/1784/PDF/f01.pdf,0

Integration principles for combining indicators within biological quality elements (BQEs) and combining BQEs into a final-integrated assessment are discussed. Specific focus has been put on combining different types of information into indices, since several methods are currently employed. As a consequence of the variety of methods used, comparisons across both BQEs and water categories (river, lakes and coastal waters) can be difficult. Based on our analyses, we conclude that some principles and methods for integration can be critical and that a harmonised approach should be developed. Further, we conclude that the integration principles applied within BQEs are critical and in need of harmonisation if we want a better understanding of potential transition in ecological status between surface water types, e.g. when riverine water enters a downstream lake or coastal water body.","[""Aquatic Organisms"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Eutrophication"",""Fresh Water"",""Risk Assessment"",""Scandinavian and Nordic Countries"",""Seawater"",""Systems Integration"",""Water Quality""]","[""Assessment"",""Biological quality elements"",""Coastal eutrophication"",""Ecological status"",""Integration"",""Water Framework Directive""]",10.1007/s13280-016-0767-8,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975775983,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5012994?pdf=render,0

However, in sufficiently calibrated models are still used in engineering practice. Case studies in the scientific literature that deal with urban water management are mostly large cities, while little attention is paid to the differing boundary conditions of smaller municipalities. Consequently, the aim of this paper is to discuss the calibration of a hydrodynamic model of a small municipality (15,000 inhabitants). To represent the spatial distribution of precipitation, three distributed rain gauges were used for model calibration. To show the uncertainties imminent to the calibration process, 17 scenarios, differing in assumptions for calibration, were distinguished. To compare the impact of the different calibration scenarios on actual design values, design rainfall events were applied. The comparison of the model results using the different typical design storm events from all the surrounding data points showed substantial differences for the assessment of the sewers regarding urban flooding, emphasizing the necessity of uncertainty analysis for hydrodynamic models. Furthermore, model calibration is of the utmost importance, because uncalibrated models tend to overestimate flooding volume and therefore result in larger diameters and retention volumes.","[""Calibration process"",""Engineering practices"",""Hydrodynamic model"",""Model calibration"",""Scientific literature"",""Uncertainty"",""Urban drainage modelling"",""Urban water management"",""Calibration"",""Cities"",""Floods"",""Hydrodynamics"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Rain"",""Uncertainty""]","[""Calibration"",""Hydrodynamic models"",""Uncertainty""]",10.2166/wst.2016.395,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016112688,,0

Granting exemptions when local flood safety measures are applied is a topic of continued debate. The Ottnager-Redl/Upper Austria case study investigates various future settlement scenarios with or without local flood protection measures (LFPM). In accordance with the legal situation in the Federal Province of Upper Austria, construction permits require flood safety up to a 100-year flood level plus 20 cm. Estimations of potential flood damage in the catchment’s residential areas are based on damage functions used to describe the structural vulnerability at an object level. Impacts are simulated with a distributed hydrological and a 2D-hydraulic model, which incorporate future settlement dynamics. In addition to linking losses to return periods, the cumulative damages within design periods are estimated using a Monte-Carlo modelling framework. Event-based and cumulative losses increase with the different settlement scenarios. The LFPM tested visibly reduce the cumulative losses as they are triggered by high-frequency/low-impact events. Considering single events, the positive effects of LFPM, specifically flexible flood barriers, generally vanish when they exceed the design level. Thus, the increased flood risk due to intensified settlement in the flood-prone area cannot be compensated by LFPM.",,"[""Flood damage"",""flood risk"",""local flood protection measure"",""Monte-Carlo"",""settlement scenario"",""vulnerability""]",10.1080/15715124.2016.1167061,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969199619,,0

For this purpose we tested salinity, sediment structure, and depth in a regression model to test their contribution to variations in BQI. The spatial variation in BQI was better explained by depth than by salinity or sediment structure. The proposed assessment method uses the residuals from the regression model between BQI and depth. With this method the variance in BQI between samples was reduced by 50% to 75% in the majority of situations.

While the use of a single score indicator may, on the one hand, ease the decision making it may also induce a loss of information. On the other hand, the use of a large set of environmental indicators may increase the difficulty of decision making due to the high number of parameters. In this paper, a statistical methodology is used to identify a simplified set of environmental indicators. This methodology applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to five LCIA methods (CML'01, Eco-indicator99, IMPACT 2002+, ecological scarcity, EPD) using a building products database. For each method, the results show that only 4-6 dimensions are sufficient to explain at least 90-95% of the variance for each set of indicators. They refer to the following environmental themes: fossil-fuel consumption, ecotoxicity, ionising radiation, land use and mineral resources. The use of a selected set of five LCI flows is found to be as relevant as current LCIA methods from a statistical point of view. Furthermore, PCA applied to a building LCA case study shows similar trends as for the database results. Further studies are now needed to confirm these findings for going towards simplified structural relationships among LCIA indicators for building materials.","[""Building products"",""Ecotoxicity"",""Environmental indicators"",""Life cycle impact assessment"",""Statistical correlation"",""Statistical methodologies"",""Structural relationship""]","[""Buildings"",""Construction materials"",""Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) indicators"",""Principal component analysis"",""Statistical correlations""]",10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.01.056,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960104383,,0

Objectives In this essay, we map out key driving forces that will shape environmental epidemiology in the next 25 years. We also identify how the field should adapt to best take advantage of coming opportunities and prepare for challenges. Discussion Future environmental epidemiologists will face a world shaped by longer lifespans but also larger burdens of chronic health conditions; shifting populations by region and into urban areas; and global environmental change. Rapidly evolving technologies, particularly in sensors and OMICs, will present opportunities for the field. How should it respond? We argue, the field best adapts to a changing world by focusing on healthy aging; evidence gaps, especially in susceptible populations and low-income countries; and by developing approaches to better handle complexity and more formalized analysis. Conclusions Environmental epidemiology informing disease prevention will continue to be valuable. However, the field must adapt to remain relevant. In particular, the field must ensure that public health importance drives research questions, while seizing the opportunities presented by new technologies.

Dynamic Thermal Simulation (DTS) programs are mainly used at a single building scale and tools made for district-scale or city-scale studies mentioned in the literature are unsuitable for high performance building designers. Therefore, building professionals involved in urban densification projects would greatly benefit from a decision-support design tool able to make an energy evaluation of the involved area, taking into account interactions between the new building and the existing district.

Our interest lies in the formation of trimethylamine (TMA), a key metabolite in both human health and climate change. Here, we focus on bacterial degradation pathways for choline, carnitine, glycine betaine and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) to TMA in human gut and marine metagenomes. We found the TMAO reductase pathway was the most prevalent pathway in both environments. Proteobacteria were found to contribute the majority of the TMAO reductase pathway sequences, except in the stressed gut, where Actinobacteria dominated. Interestingly, in the human gut metagenomes, a high proportion of the Proteobacteria hits were accounted for by the genera Klebsiella and Escherichia. Furthermore Klebsiella and Escherichia harboured three of the four potential TMA-production pathways (choline, carnitine and TMAO), suggesting they have a key role in TMA cycling in the human gut. In addition to the intensive TMAO-TMA cycling in the marine environment, our data suggest that carnitine-to-TMA transformation plays an overlooked role in aerobic marine surface waters, whereas choline-to-TMA transformation is important in anaerobic marine sediments.

For many less-developed regions, it is often difficult to find series of observed daily weather data to assist in planning decisions. This study applies a previously developed single-site weather generator (WG) to the Caribbean, using examples from Belize in the west to Barbados in the east. The purpose of this development is to provide users in the region with generated sequences of possible future daily weather that they can use in a number of impact sectors. The WG is first calibrated for a number of sites across the region and the goodness of fit of the WG against the daily station observations assessed. Particular attention is focussed on the ability of the precipitation component of the WG to generate realistic extreme values for the calibration or control period. The WG is then modified using change factors (CFs) derived from regional climate model projections (control and future) to simulate future 30-year scenarios centred on the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Changes between the control period and the three futures are illustrated not just by changes in average temperatures and precipitation amounts but also by a number of well-used measures of extremes (very warm days/nights, the heaviest 5-day precipitation total in a month, counts of the number of precipitation events above specific thresholds and the number of consecutive dry days).","[""Adaptation to climate changes"",""Caribbean"",""Developed countries"",""Down-scaling"",""Less-developed regions"",""Precipitation events"",""Regional climate modeling"",""Weather generator""]","[""Caribbean"",""downscaling"",""regional climate model"",""weather generator""]",10.1002/joc.4624,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957638709,https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/joc.4624,0

However, although the multi-facetted character of biodiversity is widely recognized, few studies have linked landscape spatial pattern and history simultaneously to multiple facets (taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic) and spatial components (α, β, and γ) of plant diversity. We set out to reveal whether landscape parameters have specific effects on the separate diversity facets and components of plant diversity at a patch scale on coastal dune landscapes of Central Italy. For each landscape patch, we computed a set of patch-based metrics relying on multi-temporal land-cover maps. Based on a database of plant community plots, on functional traits from field measurements and on a dated phylogenetic tree, we calculated taxonomic (TD), functional (FD), and phylogenetic diversity (PD) within each patch at α, β, and γ level. Diversity measures were then related to the landscape metrics via linear mixed-effect models. Landscape pattern and transformations affected TD only moderately in coastal dune ecosystems. We found much stronger and contrasted effects on FD and PD. FD increased in patches surrounded by human-dominated habitats; PD was higher in fragmented patches, particularly in the Mediterranean macchia. Moreover, landscape pattern affected differently the single communities, the turnover among communities and the pool of species within the patch (α, β, and γ components). Our results call for the combined inclusion of FD and PD and their partitions into ecological analyses, being TD too crude to capture the comprehensive and contrasted response of plant diversity to landscape spatial pattern.",,"[""diversity facets"",""landscape change"",""Mediterranean coastal dunes"",""mixed-effect models"",""partitioning of diversity"",""plant diversity""]",10.1007/s10021-016-9971-4,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961654584,,0

Methods: Each participating registry (Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America (CORRONA) (USA), Swedish Rheumatology Quality of Care Register (SRR) (Sweden), Norfolk Arthritis Register (NOAR) (UK), CORRONA International (East Europe, Latin America, India) and Institute of Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis (IORRA) (Japan)) defined a main cohort from January 2000 onwards. To address comparability and potential bias, we harmonised event definitions and defined several subcohorts for sensitivity analyses based on disease activity, treatment, calendar time, duration of follow-up and RCT exclusions. Rates were standardised for age, sex and, in one sensitivity analysis, also HAQ. Results: The combined registry cohorts included 57 251 patients with RA (234 089 person-years) - 24.5% men, mean (SD) baseline age 58.2 (13.8) and RA duration 8.2 (11.7) years. Standardised registry mortality rates (per 100 person-years) varied from 0.42 (CORRONA) to 0.80 (NOAR), with 0.60 for RCT patients. Myocardial infarction and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) rates ranged from 0.09 and 0.31 (IORRA) to 0.39 and 0.77 (SRR), with RCT rates intermediate (0.18 and 0.42), respectively. Additional subcohort analyses showed small and mostly consistent changes across registries, retaining reasonable consistency in rates across the Western registries. Additional standardisation for HAQ returned higher mortality and MACE registry rates. Conclusions: This coordinated approach to contextualising RA RCT safety data demonstrated reasonable differences and consistency in rates for mortality and CVD across registries, and comparable RCT rates, and may serve as a model method to supplement clinical trial analyses for drug development programmes.","[""Aged"",""Antirheumatic Agents"",""Arthritis, Rheumatoid"",""Bias (Epidemiology)"",""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Humans"",""India"",""Japan"",""Latin America"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Myocardial Infarction"",""North America"",""Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"",""Registries"",""Sweden"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""Cardiovascular Disease"",""Epidemiology"",""Outcomes research"",""Rheumatoid Arthritis""]",10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-208698,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958092529,,0

Two greenhouse experiments were carried out in order to determine the effect of a decreasing NO3−:Cl− ratio (80:20, 60:40, 40:60, or 20:80) and nitrate deprivation (0, 5, 10, or 15 days before harvest) on biomass production, leaf chlorophyll content and fluorescence, mineral composition, and phytochemicals in leaves of cardoon ‘Bianco Avorio’ grown in a floating system. Total phenols, flavonoids and antioxidant capacity increased linearly with Cl− availability, especially when nitrate was replaced by 80% of chloride (20:80 NO3−:Cl− ratio), without having a detrimental effect on yield. Total nitrogen and nitrate concentration in leaves decreased linearly with increasing Cl− in the nutrient solution. Total phenols and antioxidant capacity recorded after 15 days of nitrate deprivation were higher by 43.1, 42.8, and 44.3% and by 70.5, 40.9, and 62.2%, at 59, 97 and 124 days after sowing, respectively compared to the control treatment. The decrease in leaf nitrate content recorded under N-deprivation occurred more rapidly than the reduction in total nitrogen. Thus, up to 15 days of nitrate withdrawal can lower nitrates without sharply reduce total nitrogen or affecting growth and biomass of cultivated cardoon. The use of N-free nutrient solution prior to harvest or the replacement of nitrates with chlorides could be adopted among growers to improve the quality of the product and enhance sustainability of crop production system.",,"[""Antioxidant capacity"",""Cynara cardunculus L. var. altilis DC"",""Floating system"",""Nitrate/chloride ratio"",""Secondary metabolism"",""Total phenols""]",10.3389/fpls.2016.00978,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983776558,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00978/pdf,0

However, the low-density and the mismatch between energy supply and demand make appropriate its combination with thermal energy storage (TES) systems. The integration of these technologies (solar thermal and TES) in the building design is a key aspect to reduce energy consumption. Latent heat storage using phase change materials (PCM) presents an advantage in comparison to conventional sensible heat storage systems due to the required volume. In this context, an innovative system that integrates PCM inside the structural horizontal building component is presented in this paper. The slab consisted of a prefabricated concrete element with 14 channels filled with macro-encapsulated PCM which is used as a storage unit and a heating supply. In order to melt the PCM the system is coupled to a solar air collector. The prototype is tested in an experimental facility located in Puigverd de Lleida (Spain) where its thermal performance is evaluated under real weather conditions. This study demonstrates the high potential of the concrete slab on reducing the energy consumption compared to a conventional heating system.","[""Active systems"",""Conventional heating"",""Experimental facilities"",""Heating system"",""Reduce energy consumption"",""Sensible heat storages"",""Solar air collector"",""Thermal Performance""]","[""Active system"",""Energy savings"",""Heating system"",""Phase change materials (PCM)"",""Thermal energy storage (TES)""]",10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.06.069,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977513363,https://repositori.udl.cat/bitstream/10459.1/57657/5/024404.pdf,0

This paper presents an empirical analysis of the factors that affect the importance of academic knowledge for firms’ innovation activities. An integrated approach that simultaneously considers country- and firm-level factors is adopted. Regarding the former factors, the analysis shows that the entrepreneurial orientation of university and the quality of academic research increase the importance of knowledge transfers from universities to firms. This suggests that the environmental and institutional context contributes to cross-national disparities in university-industry interactions and the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. In regard to the latter factors, the results indicate that firms oriented toward open search strategies and radical innovations are more likely to draw knowledge from universities. Furthermore, firms belonging to high technology sectors and firms with high absorptive capacity place greater value on the various links with universities. With respect to firm size, the estimates show an inverted U-shaped relation with the importance of universities as a source of knowledge.","[""Effectiveness of knowledge"",""Entrepreneurial orientation"",""Innovation capability"",""Institutional contexts"",""Knowledge transfer"",""Multilevel data"",""University industries"",""University-industry interaction""]","[""Innovation"",""Knowledge transfer"",""Multilevel data"",""University entrepreneurial orientation"",""University-industry links""]",10.1007/s10961-015-9408-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84926165030,http://www.iaw.edu/RePEc/iaw/pdf/iaw_dp_113.pdf,0

Several systematic reviews have shown that a higher intensity of training can lead to better functional outcomes after stroke. Currently, the resources in inpatient settings are not always sufficient and innovative methods are necessary to meet these recommendations without increasing healthcare costs. A resource efficient method to augment intensity of training could be to involve caregivers in exercise training. A caregiver-mediated exercise programme has the potential to improve outcomes in terms of body function, activities, and participation in people with stroke. In addition, caregivers are more actively involved in the rehabilitation process, which may increase feelings of empowerment with reduced levels of caregiver burden and could facilitate the transition from rehabilitation facility (in hospital, rehabilitation centre, or nursing home) to home setting. As a consequence, length of stay might be reduced and early supported discharge could be enhanced. Objectives: To determine if caregiver-mediated exercises (CME) improve functional ability and health-related quality of life in people with stroke, and to determine the effect on caregiver burden. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (October 2015), CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library, 2015, Issue 10), MEDLINE (1946 to October 2015), Embase (1980 to December 2015), CINAHL (1982 to December 2015), SPORTDiscus (1985 to December 2015), three additional databases (two in October 2015, one in December 2015), and six additional trial registers (October 2015). We also screened reference lists of relevant publications and contacted authors in the field. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing CME to usual care, no intervention, or another intervention as long as it was not caregiver-mediated, aimed at improving motor function in people who have had a stroke. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials. One review author extracted data, and assessed quality and risk of bias, and a second review author cross-checked these data and assessed quality. We determined the quality of the evidence using GRADE. The small number of included studies limited the pre-planned analyses. Main results: We included nine trials about CME, of which six trials with 333 patient-caregiver couples were included in the meta-analysis. The small number of studies, participants, and a variety of outcome measures rendered summarising and combining of data in meta-analysis difficult. In addition, in some studies, CME was the only intervention (CME-core), whereas in other studies, caregivers provided another, existing intervention, such as constraint-induced movement therapy. For trials in the latter category, it was difficult to separate the effects of CME from the effects of the other intervention. We found no significant effect of CME on basic ADL when pooling all trial data post intervention (4 studies; standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.02 to 0.44; P = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence) or at follow-up (2 studies; mean difference (MD) 2.69, 95% CI -8.18 to 13.55; P = 0.63; low-quality evidence). In addition, we found no significant effects of CME on extended ADL at post intervention (two studies; SMD 0.07, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.35; P = 0.64; low-quality evidence) or at follow-up (2 studies; SMD 0.11, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.39; P = 0.45; low-quality evidence). Caregiver burden did not increase at the end of the intervention (2 studies; SMD -0.04, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.37; P = 0.86; moderate-quality evidence) or at follow-up (1 study; MD 0.60, 95% CI -0.71 to 1.91; P = 0.37; very low-quality evidence). At the end of intervention, CME significantly improved the secondary outcomes of standing balance (3 studies; SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.87; P = 0.002; low-quality evidence) and quality of life (1 study; physical functioning: MD 12.40, 95% CI 1.67 to 23.13; P = 0.02; mobility: MD 18.20, 95% CI 7.54 to 28.86; P = 0.0008; general recovery: MD 15.10, 95% CI 8.44 to 21.76; P < 0.00001; very low-quality evidence). At follow-up, we found a significant effect in favour of CME for Six-Minute Walking Test distance (1 study; MD 109.50 m, 95% CI 17.12 to 201.88; P = 0.02; very low-quality evidence). We also found a significant effect in favour of the control group at the end of intervention, regarding performance time on the Wolf Motor Function test (2 studies; MD -1.72, 95% CI -2.23 to -1.21; P < 0.00001; low-quality evidence). We found no significant effects for the other secondary outcomes (i.e. patient: motor impairment, upper limb function, mood, fatigue, length of stay and adverse events; caregiver: mood and quality of life). In contrast to the primary analysis, sensitivity analysis of CME-core showed a significant effect of CME on basic ADL post intervention (2 studies; MD 9.45, 95% CI 2.11 to 16.78; P = 0.01; moderate-quality evidence). The methodological quality of the included trials and variability in interventions (e.g. content, timing, and duration), affected the validity and generalisability of these observed results. Authors' conclusions: There is very low- to moderate-quality evidence that CME may be a valuable intervention to augment the pallet of therapeutic options for stroke rehabilitation. Included studies were small, heterogeneous, and some trials had an unclear or high risk of bias. Future high-quality research should determine whether CME interventions are (cost-)effective.","[""Activities of Daily Living"",""Adult"",""Caregivers"",""Exercise Therapy"",""Humans"",""Postural Balance"",""Quality of Life"",""Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"",""Stroke Rehabilitation"",""Walking""]",,10.1002/14651858.CD011058.pub2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006868898,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6463929,0

We identify a preliminary global target for reducing emissions from agriculture of ~1 GtCO2e yr−1 by 2030 to limit warming in 2100 to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. Yet plausible agricultural development pathways with mitigation cobenefits deliver only 21–40% of needed mitigation. The target indicates that more transformative technical and policy options will be needed, such as methane inhibitors and finance for new practices. A more comprehensive target for the 2 °C limit should be developed to include soil carbon and agriculture-related mitigation options. Excluding agricultural emissions from mitigation targets and plans will increase the cost of mitigation in other sectors or reduce the feasibility of meeting the 2 °C limit.","[""Agriculture"",""Carbon"",""Climate Change"",""Gases"",""Greenhouse Effect"",""International Cooperation"",""Methane"",""Public Policy"",""Soil""]","[""agriculture"",""climate change"",""integrated assessment modeling"",""mitigation"",""policy"",""target"",""United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change""]",10.1111/gcb.13340,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979970693,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/gcb.13340,0

Nonsurgical management through external immobilization is occasionally preferred to surgical management but is criticized for its higher rates of failure and lower patient satisfaction. Our aim is to analyze patient-reported outcomes in patients who underwent nonsurgical treatment for type II odontoid fractures. Methods: We identified patients >18-year-old who underwent external immobilization as a treatment for isolated type II odontoid fracture between 2007 and 2012. We collected demographic parameters, clinical presentation, mode of injury, imaging studies and modality and duration of treatment (soft collar, halo-vest, or both). Patients were contacted by telephone to participate in a 15-min survey addressing their recovery including their subjective rate of return to preinjury level of functioning. Results: Fifteen patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and participated in our survey. Patients were followed up for an average of 19 months after injury. Overall mean age was 61 years. Injury followed a mechanical fall or a road traffic accident in 11 and 4 cases, respectively. External immobilization was achieved by halo vest only in nine patients, soft collar only in two patients (13%), and through a sequential combination in the remaining 4 (27%). This was deployed for a mean of 7.8 months. Radiological studies at the last follow-up showed bony healing (27%), fibrous nonunion (60%), and persistent instability (13%). Patients reported gradual recovery of function throughout the 1st year after injury with levels above 70% of preinjury functioning achieved by 13% of patients at 6 months, 33% at 9 months, and 47% at 12 months. Overall satisfaction with nonsurgical management was 68%.

Background Although African governments struggled to provide primary health care services in the context of a global economic crisis, civil society organisations (CSO) started mobilising settlement residents to respond to another crisis: the HIV and AIDS pandemic. These initiatives actively engaged patients, families and settlement residents to provide home-based care to HIV-infected patients. After 30 years, CHBC programmes continue to be appropriate in the context of changing health care needs in the population. Methods The study took place in 2011 and 2012 and was part of a multi-country study. It used a mixed method approach involving semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, structured interviews, service observations and a questionnaire survey. Findings Our research revealed long-standing presence of extensive mutual support amongst residents in many settlements, the invocation of cultural values that emphasise social relationships and organisation of people by CSO in care and support programmes. This laid the foundation for a locally conceived model of chronic care capable of addressing the new care demands arising from the country's changing burden of disease. However, this capacity has come under threat as the reduction in donor funding to community home-based care programmes and donor and government interventions, which have changed the nature of these programmes in the country. Zambia's health system risks losing valuable capacity for fulfilling its vision 'to bring health care as close to the family as possible' if government strategies do not acknowledge the need for transformational approaches to community participation and continuation of the brokering role by CSO in primary health care.","[""Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome"",""Africa"",""Chronic Disease"",""Community Health Services"",""Delivery of Health Care"",""Focus Groups"",""HIV Infections"",""Home Care Services"",""Humans"",""Long-Term Care"",""Primary Health Care"",""Zambia""]","[""chronic care"",""Community participation"",""home-based care"",""palliative care"",""primary health care""]",10.1017/S146342361600030X,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984677432,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/4F0DAD08C446A32751AFD1AB90006E79/S146342361600030Xa.pdf/div-class-title-from-end-of-life-to-chronic-care-the-provision-of-community-home-based-care-for-hiv-and-the-adaptation-to-new-health-care-demands-in-zambia-div.pdf,0

Previous research has argued that supply chain transparency can be both a consumer tool empowering consumers to pressure disclosing firms to improve sustainability conditions and a corporate tool for increasing revenues. Based on a study of the transparency project of Swedish company Nudie Jeans, the authors demonstrate that consumers do not leverage transparency but that transparency improves consumer willingness to buy. In doing this, the authors contribute to the literature in two important ways. First, the authors provide one of the first, if not the first, studies of whether consumers in practice leverage increased supply chain transparency, challenging the previous research claim that supply chain transparency is a useful consumer tool. Second, the authors move beyond studies of purchasing intentions and willingness to buy in experimental settings and confirm that supply chain transparency is a useful corporate tool in practice.

An increased requirement for nutrients includes the introduction of protein-rich solid foods, such as seafood, which additionally provides valuable omega-3 fatty acids. However, consumption of seafood is low in the British child population. The aim of this study was to identify maternal perceptions of the factors that can influence the decision on whether to provide seafood during early years' feeding using a multi-method qualitative study design. A total of 26 discussions posted by mothers on parenting websites; Mumknowsbest, Mumsnet and Netmums, accessed July 2013, together with discussions from six focus groups (February–July 2014) in the North East of Scotland were included for thematic qualitative analysis. Discussions on the inclusion of seafood during the early years were centred across four interrelating themes; - food-related attributes, mother-centred aspects, family-centred aspects, and external information sources. Concerns regarding safety and mothers' limited knowledge and skills on seafood were apparent from discussions; however, the practicalities of providing a cost effective family meal were also issues raised by mothers. An understanding of the numerous and sometimes contradictory influences on mothers' decisions to include seafood during early years' period could be used to develop strategies to help increase regular seafood consumption. In particular, ensuring formal information and guidance clearly addresses the safety concerns of mothers and the development of practical education schemes to encourage and teach cooking skills should be considered.","[""Child Development"",""Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"",""Child, Preschool"",""Cooking"",""Family"",""Feeding Behavior"",""Female"",""Fisheries"",""Focus Groups"",""Food Contamination"",""Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"",""Healthy Diet"",""Humans"",""Infant"",""Internet"",""Male"",""Maternal Behavior"",""Patient Compliance"",""Qualitative Research"",""Scotland"",""Seafood"",""Social Networking""]","[""Concerns"",""Early years"",""Infant feeding"",""Mothers"",""Online forums"",""Seafood""]",10.1016/j.appet.2016.10.010,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992223827,https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/11833/1/Carstairs_2016_Appetite_Mothers_decision_AM.pdf,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. All rights reserved.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the Cavalier trial was to evaluate the safety and performance of the Perceval sutureless aortic valve in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). We report the 30-day clinical and haemodynamic outcomes from the largest study cohort with a sutureless valve. METHODS: FromFebruary 2010 to September 2013, 658 consecutive patients (mean age 77.8 years; 64.4% females; mean logistic EuroSCORE 10.2%) underwent AVR in 25 European Centres. Isolated AVRs were performed in 451 (68.5%) patients with a less invasive approach in 219 (33.3%) cases. Of the total, 40.0% were octogenarians. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve was considered an exclusion criterion. RESULTS: Implantation was successful in 628 patients (95.4%). In isolated AVR through sternotomy, the mean cross-clamp time and the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time were 32.6 and 53.7 min, and with the less invasive approach 38.8 and 64.5 min, respectively. The 30-day overall and valve-related mortality rates were 3.7 and 0.5%, respectively. Valve explants, stroke and endocarditis occurred in 0.6, 2.1 and in 0.1% of cases, respectively. Preoperative mean and peak pressure gradients decreased from 44.8 and 73.24 mmHg to 10.24 and 19.27 mmHg at discharge, respectively. The mean effective orifice area improved from 0.72 to 1.46 cm2. CONCLUSIONS: The current 30-day results show that the Perceval valve is safe (favourable haemodynamic effect and low complication rate), and can be implanted with a fast and reproducible technique after a short learning period. Short cross-clamp and CPB times were achieved in both isolated and combined procedures. The Perceval valve represents a promising alternative to biological AVR, especially with a less invasive approach and in older patients.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Aortic Valve"",""Device Removal"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Heart Valve Prosthesis"",""Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation"",""Hemodynamics"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Prospective Studies"",""Prosthesis Design""]","[""Aortic valve replacement"",""Multicentre study"",""Sutureless aortic valve prosthesis""]",10.1093/ejcts/ezv257,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962859051,https://academic.oup.com/ejcts/article-pdf/49/3/978/8067857/ezv257.pdf,0

All rights Reserved.Objectives To assess risk factors associated with non-fatal injuries (NFIs) from road traffic accidents (RTAs) or falls. Methods Our study included 151 609 participants from the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological study. Participants reported whether they experienced injuries within the past 12 months that limited normal activities. Additional questions elicited data on risk factors. We employed multivariable logistic regression to analyse data. Results Overall, 5979 participants (3.9% of 151 609) reported at least one NFI. Total number of NFIs was 6300: 1428 were caused by RTAs (22.7%), 1948 by falls (30.9%) and 2924 by other causes (46.4%). Married/common law status was associated with fewer falls, but not with RTA. Age 65–70 years was associated with fewer RTAs, but more falls; age 55–64 years was associated with more falls. Male versus female was associated with more RTAs and fewer falls. In lowermiddle- income countries, rural residence was associated with more RTAs and falls; in low-income countries, rural residence was associated with fewer RTAs. Previous alcohol use was associated with more RTAs and falls; current alcohol use was associated with more falls. Education was not associated with either NFI type. Conclusions This study of persons aged 35–70 years found that some risk factors for NFI differ according to whether the injury is related to RTA or falls. Policymakers may use these differences to guide the design of prevention policies for RTA-related or fall-related NFI.","[""Accidental Falls"",""Accidents, Traffic"",""Adult"",""Age Distribution"",""Aged"",""Alcohol Drinking"",""Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System"",""Cross-Sectional Studies"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Policy Making"",""Primary Prevention"",""Prospective Studies"",""Public Health"",""Risk Factors"",""Rural Population"",""Sex Distribution"",""Urban Population""]",,10.1136/injuryprev-2014-041476,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84947599369,,0

Method 199 Patients < 75 years with ACS were randomised to PCC plus usual care or usual care alone and followed for 6 months from hospital to outpatient care and primary care. For the PCC group, patients and health care professionals co-created a PCC health plan reflecting both perspectives, which induced a continued collaboration in person-centred teams at each health care level. A composite score of changes that included general self-efficacy assessment, return to work or previous activity level, re-hospitalisation or death was used as outcome measure. Results In the group of patients without postsecondary education (n = 90) the composite score showed a significant improvement in favour of the PCC intervention (n = 40) vs. usual care (n = 50) at six months (35.0%, n = 14 vs. 16.0%, n = 8; odds ratio (OR) = 2.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0–7.7, P = 0.041). In patients with postsecondary education (n = 109), a non-significant difference in favour of the PCC intervention (n = 54) vs. usual care (n = 55) was observed in the composite score (13.0%, n = 7 vs 3.6%, n = 2; OR = 3.9, 95% CI: 0.8–19.9, P = 0.097). Conclusion A PCC approach, which stresses the necessity of a patient–health care professional partnership, is beneficial in patients with low education after an ACS event. Because these patients have been identified as a vulnerable group in cardiac rehabilitation, we suggest that PCC can be integrated into conventional cardiac rehabilitation programmes to improve both equity in uptake and health outcomes.

Strategies to reach these results include scaling-up HIV Testing and Counselling (HTC); Preventing Mother-To-Child Transmission (PMTCT); and strengthening Care and Treatment Clinic (CTC) services. Previous studies showed that HIV policy and guideline recommendations were not always implemented in rural South Tanzania. This study aims to identify the determinants of HIV guideline implementation. A qualitative study of 23 semi-structured interviews with facility in-charges; healthcare workers; district, regional and national HIV coordinators was conducted. Five health facilities were purposively selected by level, ownership and proximity to district headquarters. Interviews were analysed according to Fleuren's five determinants of innovation uptake related to: strategies used in guideline development and dissemination; guideline characteristics; the guideline implementing organization; guideline users; and the socio-cultural and regulatory context. None of the facilities had the HTC national guideline document. Non-involvement of providers in revisions and weak planning for guideline dissemination impeded their implementation. Lengthy guidelines and those written in English were underused, and activities perceived to be complicated, like WHO-staging, were avoided. Availability of staff and lack of supplies like test kits and medication impeded implementation. Collaboration between facilities enhanced implementation, as did peer-support among providers. Provider characteristics including education level, knowledge of, and commitment to the guideline influenced implementation. According to providers, determinants of clients' service use included gender norms, stigma, trust and perceived benefits. The regulatory context prohibited private hospitals from buying HIV supplies. Being tools for bringing policies to practice, national guidelines are crucial in the efforts towards the three zeros. Strategies to improve providers' adherence to guidelines should include development of clearer guideline dissemination plans, strengthening of the health system, and possibly addressing of provider-perceived patient-level barriers to utilizing HIV services.","[""Adult"",""Counseling"",""Culture"",""Female"",""Guideline Adherence"",""Guidelines as Topic"",""Health Policy"",""HIV Infections"",""Humans"",""Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Patient Acceptance of Health Care"",""Qualitative Research"",""Rural Population"",""Tanzania""]","[""HIV policy and guidelines"",""Implementation gaps and determinants"",""Rural Tanzania""]",10.1093/heapol/czx023,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021807792,https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-pdf/32/6/825/17637642/czx023.pdf,0

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY licenseBackground Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures. Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography–year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95% uncertainty interval 61·4–61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5–72·2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11·3 years (3·7–17·4), to 62·6 years (56·5–70·2). Total deaths increased by 4·1% (2·6–5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million (54·9 million to 56·6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0% (15·8–18·1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1% (12·6–16·0) to 39·8 million (39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13·1% (11·9–14·3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42·1%, 39·1–44·6), malaria (43·1%, 34·7–51·8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29·8%, 24·8–34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1%, 19·3–37·1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000–183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000–532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death. Interpretation At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI. Against this background of progress, some countries have seen falls in life expectancy, and age-standardised death rates for some causes are increasing. Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY license.Background Established in 2000, Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) catalysed extraordinary political, financial, and social commitments to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. At the country level, the pace of progress in improving child survival has varied markedly, highlighting a crucial need to further examine potential drivers of accelerated or slowed decreases in child mortality. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides an analytical framework to comprehensively assess these trends for under-5 mortality, age-specific and cause-specific mortality among children under 5 years, and stillbirths by geography over time. Methods Drawing from analytical approaches developed and refined in previous iterations of the GBD study, we generated updated estimates of child mortality by age group (neonatal, post-neonatal, ages 1–4 years, and under 5) for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational geographies, from 1980–2015. We also estimated numbers and rates of stillbirths for these geographies and years. Gaussian process regression with data source adjustments for sampling and non-sampling bias was applied to synthesise input data for under-5 mortality for each geography. Age-specific mortality estimates were generated through a two-stage age–sex splitting process, and stillbirth estimates were produced with a mixed-effects model, which accounted for variable stillbirth definitions and data source-specific biases. For GBD 2015, we did a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in child mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and annualised rates of decrease for under-5 mortality and stillbirths as they related to the Soci-demographic Index (SDI). Second, we examined the ratio of recorded and expected levels of child mortality, on the basis of SDI, across geographies, as well as differences in recorded and expected annualised rates of change for under-5 mortality. Third, we analysed levels and cause compositions of under-5 mortality, across time and geographies, as they related to rising SDI. Finally, we decomposed the changes in under-5 mortality to changes in SDI at the global level, as well as changes in leading causes of under-5 deaths for countries and territories. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 child mortality estimation process, as well as data sources, in accordance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, 5·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·7–6·0) children younger than 5 years died in 2015, representing a 52·0% (95% UI 50·7–53·3) decrease in the number of under-5 deaths since 1990. Neonatal deaths and stillbirths fell at a slower pace since 1990, decreasing by 42·4% (41·3–43·6) to 2·6 million (2·6–2·7) neonatal deaths and 47·0% (35·1–57·0) to 2·1 million (1·8-2·5) stillbirths in 2015. Between 1990 and 2015, global under-5 mortality decreased at an annualised rate of decrease of 3·0% (2·6–3·3), falling short of the 4·4% annualised rate of decrease required to achieve MDG4. During this time, 58 countries met or exceeded the pace of progress required to meet MDG4. Between 2000, the year MDG4 was formally enacted, and 2015, 28 additional countries that did not achieve the 4·4% rate of decrease from 1990 met the MDG4 pace of decrease. However, absolute levels of under-5 mortality remained high in many countries, with 11 countries still recording rates exceeding 100 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. Marked decreases in under-5 deaths due to a number of communicable diseases, including lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and malaria, accounted for much of the progress in lowering overall under-5 mortality in low-income countries. Compared with gains achieved for infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies, the persisting toll of neonatal conditions and congenital anomalies on child survival became evident, especially in low-income and low-middle-income countries. We found sizeable heterogeneities in comparing observed and expected rates of under-5 mortality, as well as differences in observed and expected rates of change for under-5 mortality. At the global level, we recorded a divergence in observed and expected levels of under-5 mortality starting in 2000, with the observed trend falling much faster than what was expected based on SDI through 2015. Between 2000 and 2015, the world recorded 10·3 million fewer under-5 deaths than expected on the basis of improving SDI alone. Interpretation Gains in child survival have been large, widespread, and in many places in the world, faster than what was anticipated based on improving levels of development. Yet some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still had high rates of under-5 mortality in 2015. Unless these countries are able to accelerate reductions in child deaths at an extraordinary pace, their achievement of proposed SDG targets is unlikely. Improving the evidence base on drivers that might hasten the pace of progress for child survival, ranging from cost-effective intervention packages to innovative financing mechanisms, is vital to charting the pathways for ultimately ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

Journal of The Journal of Eukaryotic Microbiology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of International Society of Protistologists.Colourless, nonscaled chrysophytes comprise morphologically similar or even indistinguishable flagellates which are important bacterivors in water and soil crucial for ecosystem functioning. However, phylogenetic analyses indicate a multiple origin of such colourless, nonscaled flagellate lineages. These flagellates are often referred to as ""Spumella-like flagellates"" in ecological and biogeographic studies. Although this denomination reflects an assumed polyphyly, it obscures the phylogenetic and taxonomic diversity of this important flagellate group and, thus, hinders progress in lineage- and taxon-specific ecological surveys. The smallest representatives of colourless chrysophytes have been addressed in very few taxonomic studies although they are among the dominant flagellates in field communities. To overcome the blurred picture and set the field for further investigation in biogeography and ecology of the organisms in question, we studied a set of strains of specifically small, colourless, nonscaled chrysomonad flagellates by means of electron microscopy and molecular analyses. They were isolated by a filtration-acclimatisation approach focusing on flagellates of around 5 μm.

Methods A regional population-based cohort study of women diagnosed with primary ovarian and fallopian tube cancers and included in the Swedish Quality Registry (SQR) during 2008–2013 in a region where primary care of advanced stages was centralized in 2011. Surgical, oncological characteristics, outcomes, follow-ups and relative survivals were analyzed. Results There were 817 women diagnosed with ovarian and fallopian tube cancers during 2008–2013 and 523 were classified as FIGO stage III-IV and further analyzed. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) was performed in 81% and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) in 11%. Complete cytoreduction at PDS was performed in 37% before compared to 49% after centralization (p < 0.03).

The newer frontiers of therapeutic development regard the discovery of oncogene driven tumours: however, the majority of NSCLC patients are wild type and they cannot be treated with targeted based agents. The recent positive results obtained with immunotherapy and with the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors and docetaxel, changed the therapeutic scenario of the second line therapy of non squamous NSCLC without actionable mutations. A major issue is currently the lack of predictive biomarkers that could help the oncologists in the choice of the best second-line treatment. Aim of this project was to define an optimal therapeutic pathway for patients with non-squamous NSCLC, through a working group of a large number of Italian lung cancer oncologists. Panellists have identified and discussed the more significant criteria in the second-line setting for a therapeutic decision between the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors plus chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

Almost a threefold increase over land (two fold over the ocean) has been calculated for soluble N deposition due to human activities from 1850 to present. The investigated projections indicate significant changes in the regional distribution of N deposition and chemical composition, with reduced compounds gaining importance relative to oxidized ones, but very small changes in the global total flux. Sensitivity simulations quantify uncertainties due to the investigated model parameterizations of IN partitioning onto aerosols and of N chemically fixed on organics to be within 10% for the total soluble N deposition and between 25% and 35% for the dissolved ON deposition. Larger uncertainties are associated with N emissions.","[""Air sea interactions"",""Anthropogenic effects"",""Atmosphere-ocean interactions"",""Atmospheric nitrogen deposition"",""Chemistry transport model"",""Environmental chemicals"",""Model inter comparisons"",""Total nitrogen deposition""]","[""Aerosols"",""Air quality"",""Air-sea interaction"",""Anthropogenic effects"",""Atmosphere-ocean interaction"",""Chemistry, atmospheric"",""Physical Meteorology and Climatology""]",10.1175/JAS-D-15-0278.1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84965138229,https://doi.org/10.1175/jas-d-15-0278.1,0

Novel analytical tools have been developed that correct for bias arising from imperfect detectability, species misidentification and spatial autocorrelation between detection survey replicates that can affect transect surveys. To date they have been applied individually, but their combined value is unclear. The recovery of carnivores such as the European pine marten Martes martes potentially has far reaching, but largely unknown, implications for ecosystem restoration. Analysis of the species' distribution has as yet been crude and hence unsuited for informing management. We aimed to assess the validity of standard scat surveys to provide recommendations to increase inference from future surveys. We employed spatially replicated scat surveys along forest paths in NE Scotland, genetic verification of scat provenance and occupancy modelling techniques to quantify pine marten detectability and variation therein. Detectability for 1 km and 1.5 km transects, comparable to standard protocols, was estimated to be 0.35 and 0.58 respectively, highlighting the importance of accounting for imperfect detectability. Detection probabilities decreased with vegetation cover and increased with path width. Models accounting for spatial autocorrelation between adjacent transect segments suggested that segments of ≥ 400 m could be analysed as spatial replicates with negligible bias. As is the norm, not all scats yielded DNA to genetically verify they were produced by pine marten. This was accounted for through the use of 'miss-classification occupancy models' which allowed the use of unverified scats, increasing detection probabilities while accounting for the probability of unverified scats being false positive detections. This study exemplifies that robust inference on species occupancy is achievable through careful consideration of sampling design and the application of readily available analytical techniques.

This study aims to identify the 10 largest public and philanthropic health research funding organizations in the world, to report on what they fund, and on how they distribute their funds. Methods: The world's key health research funding organizations were identified through a search strategy aimed at identifying different types of funding organizations. Organizations were ranked by their reported total annual health research expenditures. For the 10 largest funding organizations, data were collected on (1) funding amounts allocated towards 20 health areas, and (2) schemes employed for distributing funding (intramural/extramural, project/'people'/organizational and targeted/untargeted funding). Data collection consisted of a review of reports and websites and interviews with representatives of funding organizations. Data collection was challenging; data were often not reported or reported using different classification systems. Results: Overall, 55 key health research funding organizations were identified. The 10 largest funding organizations together funded research for $37.1 billion, constituting 40% of all public and philanthropic health research spending globally. The largest funder was the United States National Institutes of Health ($26.1 billion), followed by the European Commission ($3.7 billion), and the United Kingdom Medical Research Council ($1.3 billion). The largest philanthropic funder was the Wellcome Trust ($909.1 million), the largest funder of health research through official development assistance was USAID ($186.4 million), and the largest multilateral funder was the World Health Organization ($135.0 million). Funding distribution mechanisms and funding patterns varied substantially between the 10 largest funders. Conclusions: There is a need for increased transparency about who the main funders of health research areglobally, what they fund and how they decide on what gets funded, and for improving the evidence base for various funding models.

Several risk factors have been associated with asthma mortality, including a history of near-fatal asthma requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, hospitalization or emergency care visit for asthma in the past year, currently using or having recently stopped using oral corticosteroids (a marker of event severity), not currently using inhaled corticosteroids, a history of psychiatric disease or psychosocial problems, poor adherence with asthma medications and/or poor adherence with (or lack of) a written asthma action plan, food allergy in a patient with asthma.

Small-scale fisheries, industrial large-scale fisheries, domestic and legal and illegal foreign fisheries and their discards are all included. Total catches were estimated at 2.7 million tonnes over the time period considered, of which 653 000 t were caught domestically compared to 187 000 t reported by FAO. This shows that fisheries have more importance for Equatorial Guinea's food security than the official data suggest. In contrast to what is suggested by official figures, fisheries were shown to be strongly impacted by civil and political unrest; notably, they declined overall because of civil and political conflicts, socio-demographic dynamics, and a growing role of the newly discovered oil resources, which directly and indirectly threaten the food security of the people of Equatorial Guinea.

Depressing numbers of invasive species to a level where their impact on native biodiversity is tolerable requires overcoming the impact of compensatory immigration from non-controlled portions of the landscape. Because of the expected scale-dependency of dispersal, the overall size of invasive species management areas relative to the dispersal ability of the controlled species will determine the size of any effectively conserved core area unaffected by immigration from surrounding areas. However, when dispersal is male-biased, as in many mammalian invasive carnivores, males may be overrepresented amongst immigrants, reducing the potential growth rate of invasive species populations in re-invaded areas. Using data collected from a project that gradually imposed spatially comprehensive control on invasive American mink (Neovison vison) over a 10,000 km2 area of NE Scotland, we show that mink captures were reduced to almost zero in 3 years, whilst there was a threefold increase in the proportion of male immigrants. Dispersal was often long distance and linking adjacent river catchments, asymptoting at 38 and 31 km for males and females respectively. Breeding and dispersal were spatially heterogeneous, with 40 % of river sections accounting for most captures of juvenile (85 %), adult female (65 %) and immigrant (57 %) mink. Concentrating control effort on such areas, so as to turn them into “attractive dispersal sinks” could make a disproportionate contribution to the management of recurrent re-invasion of mainland invasive species management areas.",,"[""Compensation"",""Control"",""Dispersal"",""Hotspots"",""Immigration"",""Mink""]",10.1007/s10530-016-1199-x,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976502926,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc7175656?pdf=render,0

We found that most dyslexic children showed a phonological deficit, either in terms of response accuracy (92.1% of the sample), speed (84.8%), or both (79.3%). Deficits in visual attention span, as measured by partial report ability, affected 28.1% of dyslexic participants, all of which also showed a phonological deficit. Visual stress, as measured by subjective reports of visual discomfort, affected 5.5% of dyslexic participants, not more than controls (8.5%). Although phonological variables explained a large amount of variance in literacy skills, visual variables did not explain any additional variance. Finally, children with comorbid phonological and visual deficits did not show more severe reading disability than children with a pure phonological deficit. These results (a) confirm the importance of phonological deficits in dyslexia; (b) suggest that visual attention span may play a role, but a minor one, at least in this population; (c) do not support any involvement of visual stress in dyslexia. Among the factors that may explain some differences with previously published studies, the present sample is characterized by very stringent inclusion criteria, in terms of the severity of reading disability and in terms of exclusion of comorbidities.

Education Against Tobacco (EAT) is a multinational network of medical students who volunteer for school-based prevention in the classroom setting, amongst other activities. EAT has been implemented in 28 medical schools in Germany and is present in 13 additional countries around the globe. A recent quasi-experimental study showed significant short-term smoking cessation effects on 11-to-15-year-old adolescents. Objective: The aim of this study was to provide the first randomized long-term evaluation of the optimized 2014 EAT curriculum involving a photoaging software for its effectiveness in reducing the smoking prevalence among 11-to-15-year-old pupils in German secondary schools. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken with 1504 adolescents from 9 German secondary schools, aged 11-15 years in grades 6-8, of which 718 (47.74%) were identifiable for the prospective sample at the 12-month follow-up. The experimental study design included measurements at baseline (t1), 6 months (t2), and 12 months postintervention (t3), via questionnaire. The study groups consisted of 40 randomized classes that received the standardized EAT intervention (two medical student-led interactive modules taking 120 minutes total) and 34 control classes within the same schools (no intervention). The primary endpoint was the difference in smoking prevalence from t1 to t3 in the control group versus the difference from t1 to t3 in the intervention group. The differences in smoking behavior (smoking onset, quitting) between the two groups, as well as gender-specific effects, were studied as secondary outcomes. Results: None of the effects were significant due to a high loss-to-follow-up effect (52.26%, 786/1504). From baseline to the two follow-up time points, the prevalence of smoking increased from 3.1% to 5.2% to 7.2% in the control group and from 3.0% to 5.4% to 5.8% in the intervention group (number needed to treat [NNT]=68). Notable differences were observed between the groups for the female gender (4.2% to 9.5% for control vs 4.0% to 5.2% for intervention; NNT=24 for females vs NNT=207 for males), low educational background (7.3% to 12% for control vs 6.1% to 8.7% for intervention; NNT=30), and migrational background (students who claimed that at least one parent was not born in Germany) at the 12-month follow-up.

In marly areas in the Southern French Alps, both harsh water erosion and drought conditions in summer due to the Mediterranean mountainous climate prevent the natural implementation and regeneration of vegetation. Soil fertility improvement is sometimes necessary. With the purpose of revegetating such areas, we aimed to evaluate the effects of wood chip amendments on the revegetation performance of different native or sub-spontaneous plant species. We conducted two experiments on steep slopes over three growing seasons (2012-2014). The first consisted of planting seedlings (10 species), and the second consisted of seeding (nine species including six used in the first experiment). First we noted that wood chips were able to remain in place even in steep slope conditions. The planting of seedlings showed both an impact of wood chip amendment and differences between species. A positive effect of wood chips was shown with overall improvement of plant survival (increasing by 11% on average, by up to 50% for some species).

Objectives: The aim of this study is to survey the level of knowledge and attitudes towards gender-related aspects at 2 German medical schools. Materials and Methods: An online questionnaire was used to collect data on gender competence in medicine including biological basics of sex differences, clinical aspects, socio-cultural factors as well as questions regarding gender role concepts. In total 1 671 students, 330 basic scientists, 413 physicians and 53 professors from the German Medical Schools Münster and Duisburg-Essen took part in the survey. Results: The level of knowledge on gender-specific aspects in medicine is unsatisfactory at both medical schools. The average of correct answers on gender-related questions of all groups is less than 55%. Looking at gender sensitivity the existence and importance of gender disparities in medicine is agreed upon by the majority of participants. However, most of them regard only the patients' but not the physician's sex as relevant. Conclusions: The study reveals a lack of knowledge and the necessity for improvement: the integration of gender-specific aspects into medical routine is an important step towards a truly individualized medical care.","[""Adult"",""Clinical Competence"",""Education, Medical"",""Educational Measurement"",""Female"",""Germany"",""Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Sex Distribution"",""Students"",""Young Adult""]","[""curriculum development"",""gender"",""individualized medicine"",""medical education"",""sex""]",10.1055/s-0034-1396845,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84924105725,,0

These attributes include significant weight loss, reduced food intake, gonadal atrophy and pelage change with short-day photoperiod as in winter. The central mechanisms driving seasonal phenotype change during winter are mediated by a reduced availability of hypothalamic triiodothyronine (T3), although the downstream mechanisms responsible for physiological and behavioural changes are yet to be fully clarified. With access to a running wheel (RW) in short photoperiod, Siberian hamsters that have undergone photoperiod-mediated weight loss over-ride photoperiod-drive for reduced body weight and regain weight similar to a hamster held in long days. These changes occur despite retaining the majority of hypothalamic gene expression profiles appropriate for short-day hamsters. Utilising the somatostatin agonist pasireotide, we recently provided evidence for an involvement of the growth hormone (GH) axis in the seasonal regulation of bodyweight. In the present study, we employed pasireotide to test for the possible involvement of the GH axis in RW-induced body weight regulation. Pasireotide successfully inhibited exercise-stimulated growth in short-day hamsters and this was accompanied by altered hypothalamic gene expression of key GH axis components. Our data provide support for an involvement of the GH axis in the RW response in Siberian hamsters.","[""Animals"",""Body Composition"",""Body Weight"",""Cricetinae"",""Eating"",""Growth Hormone-Releasing Hormone"",""Hypothalamus"",""Iodide Peroxidase"",""Male"",""Motor Activity"",""Neuropeptide Y"",""Organ Size"",""Phodopus"",""Photoperiod"",""Pro-Opiomelanocortin"",""Receptors, Somatotropin"",""Somatostatin""]","[""circadian"",""Dehnel's phenomenon"",""exercise"",""growth hormone"",""Phodopus sungorus"",""seasonality""]",10.1111/jne.12448,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010867886,https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/9879/1/Accepted_manuscript_combined_files_21_Nov_16.pdf,0

Indeed, wood anatomical, chemical, and other properties of tree rings are a synthesis of several intrinsic and external factors, and their interaction during tree growth. In particular, Intra-Annual Density Fluctuations (IADFs) can be considered as tree-ring anomalies that can be used to better understand tree growth and to reconstruct past climate conditions with intra-annual resolution. However, the ecophysiological processes behind IADF formation, as well as their functional impact, remain unclear. Are IADFs resulting from a prompt adjustment to fluctuations in environmental conditions to avoid stressful conditions and/or to take advantage from favorable conditions? In this paper we discuss: (1) the influence of climatic factors on the formation of IADFs; (2) the occurrence of IADFs in different species and environments; (3) the potential of new approaches to study IADFs and identify their triggering factors. Our final aim is to underscore the advantages offered by network analyses of data and the importance of high-resolution measurements to gain insight into IADFs formation processes and their relations with climatic conditions, including extreme weather events.",,"[""IADF"",""Network analysis"",""Stable isotopes"",""Tree-ring"",""Wood anatomy"",""Wood formation""]",10.3389/fpls.2016.00595,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983398026,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.00595/pdf,0

The scaffolding, between individualization and distancing, aims at the appropriation of know-how which explicitly mobilizes knowledge, which is itself within the process of appropriation. Conversely, knowledge makes sense because it participates in the know-how involved.

This paper reports on a study of the Swedish individual transferable quota system introduced in 2009 for the pelagic fishery. The new system was motivated mainly by economic arguments and, thus, the need to get incentives right. Despite this, the design of the Swedish system weakened the intended incentive effects in several ways, compared with the foreign systems that served as models.

All right reserved.Several theories have sought to explain aging, here precisely defined as “increasing mortality with increasing chronological age in populations in the wild”. They all fall within one of two opposite and incompatible paradigms. For the first (“old paradigm”), aging is the result of degenerative phenomena that natural selection cannot counteract completely, due to insufficient strength or opposing selective pressures. For the second (“new paradigm”), aging is favoured by natural selection in terms of supra-individual selection: it belongs to a broader category of phenomena, on the whole defined as “phenoptosis”, which are explicable only in terms of supra-individual selection. For the new paradigm, aging is a specific function that is genetically determined and regulated, with its own physiology, pathology and phylogeny. This paper describes the theoretical arguments and the empirical evidence that support or are in contrast with each of the two paradigms. Subsequently, on the basis of an imposing and authoritative amount of research, aging mechanisms at the cellular and organismal levels are described. The clear existence of such mechanisms is indispensable proof to support the new paradigm and is in complete and unsolvable contrast with the old paradigm.",,"[""Aging"",""Cancer"",""Cell senescence"",""Phenoptosis"",""Subtelomere"",""Supra-individual selection"",""Telomere""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016329970,,0

Visual field defects and hypopituitarism, both related to mass effect, remain the leading symptoms, although these masses can be completely asymptomatic (pituitary incidentalomas) or eventually disclosed upon occurrence of apoplexy (10 %). Nevertheless, because ageing is related to several endocrinological and metabolic changes, including significant modification of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal functions, clinical features of the eventual pituitary disorder may be misdiagnosed. The rates of prevalence for macroadenomas in elderly are higher as compared to the other age groups, but these tumours do not present inner increased invasiveness, probably due to the lower cell proliferation rate identified. The surgical management of pituitary adenomas in the elderly is somehow burdened by the presence of mild and/or severe systemic co-morbidities (specially cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological disorders) found in more than 50 % of patients; this aspect dramatically increases anaesthesiological risk and significantly the mortality rate between young and elderly patients.

All right reserved.Background Sepsis treatment has been associated with high costs. Furthermore, both the incidence of sepsis and the severity of illness at presentation appear to be increasing. We estimated healthcare costs related to the treatment of patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) and aimed to explain variability in costs between individuals. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study in patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic shock to the ICUs of two tertiary centres in the Netherlands. Resource use was valued using a bottom-up micro-costing approach. Multivariable regression analysis was used to study variability in costs. Results Overall, 651 patients were included, of which 294 presented with septic shock. Mean costs were €2250 (95% CI €2235-€2266) per day and €29,102 (95% CI €26,598-€31,690) per ICU admission. Of the total expenditure, 74% was related to accommodation, personnel, and disposables, 12% to diagnostic procedures, and 14% to therapeutic interventions. Patients with septic shock had higher costs compared with patients with severe sepsis (additional costs: €69 (95% CI €37-€100) per day, and €8355 (95% CI €3400-€13,367) per admission). Site of infection, causative organism, presence of shock, and immunodeficiency were independently associated with costs, but explained only 11% of the total variance.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background: Although widely accepted as being one of the most important public health advances of the past hundred years, the contribution that improving sanitation coverage can make to child health is still unclear, especially since the publication of two large studies of sanitation in India which found no effect on child morbidity. We hypothesis that the value of sanitation does not come directly from use of improved sanitation but from improving community coverage. If this is so we further hypothesise that the relationship between sanitation coverage and child health will be non-linear and that most of any health improvement will accrue as sanitation becomes universal. Methods: We report a fixed effects panel analysis of country level data using Generalized Additive Models in R. Outcome variables were under 5 childhood mortality, neonatal mortality, under 5 childhood mortality from diarrhoea, proportion of children under 5 with stunting and with underweight. Predictor variables were %coverage by improved sanitation, improved water source, Gross Domestic Product per capita and Health Expenditure per capita. We also identified three studies reporting incidence of diarrhoea in children under five alongside gains in community coverage in improved sanitation. Findings: For each of the five outcome variables, sanitation coverage was independently associated with the outcome but this association was highly non-linear. Improving sanitation coverage was very strongly associated with under 5 years diarrhoea mortality, under 5years allcause mortality, and all-cause neonatal mortality. There was a decline as sanitation coverage increased up to about 20% but then no further decline was seen until about 70% (60% for diarrhoea mortality and 80% for neonatal mortality, respectively). The association was less strong for stunting and underweight but a threshold about 50% coverage was also seen. Three large trials of sanitation on diarrhoea morbidity gave results that were similar to what would have been predicted by our model. Conclusions: Improving sanitation coverage may be one of the more effective means to reduce childhood mortality, but only if high levels of community coverage are achieved. Studies of the impact of sanitation that focus on the individual's use of improved sanitation as the predictor variable rather than community coverage is likely to severely underestimate the impact of sanitation.",,,10.1371/journal.pone.0164571,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992648202,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164571&type=printable,0

Published by Elsevier Ltd.Social exclusion is a distressing experience and can lead to both retaliatory and prosocial reactions toward the sources of exclusion. The way people react to social exclusion has been hypothesized to be shaped through chronic exposure to peer rejection. This functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study examined associations between chronic peer rejection and retaliatory (i.e. punishing) and prosocial (i.e. forgiving) reactions to social exclusion and the neural processes underlying them. Chronically rejected (n = 19) and stably highly accepted adolescents (n = 27) distributed money between themselves and unknown others who previously included or excluded them in a virtual ball-tossing game (Cyberball). Decreasing the excluders' monetary profits (i.e., punishment) was associated with increased activity in the ventral striatum, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and parietal cortex in both groups. Compared to stably highly accepted adolescents, chronically rejected adolescents exhibited higher activity in the dorsal striatum and lateral prefrontal cortex - brain regions implicated in cognitive control - when they refrained from punishment and shared their money equally with (i.e. forgave) the excluders. These results provide insights into processes that might underlie the maintenance of peer rejection across development, such as difficulties controlling the urge to retaliate after exclusion.","[""Adolescent"",""Brain"",""Child"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Interpersonal Relations"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Magnetic Resonance Imaging"",""Male"",""Peer Group"",""Photic Stimulation"",""Punishment"",""Social Distance""]","[""Bullying"",""fMRI"",""Forgiveness"",""Ostracism"",""Peer status"",""Punishment""]",10.1016/j.dcn.2016.05.004,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971516784,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2016.05.004,0

For many diverse yet undersampled areas, however, the consequences of this impact are still poorly known. In Europe, particular uncertainty surrounds the role of Balkans, a major hotspot of European diversity, in postglacial recolonization of more northerly areas, and the Carpathians, a debatable candidate for a northern 'cryptic' glacial refugium. Using genome-wide SNPs and microsatellites, we examined how the interplay of historical processes and niche shifts structured genetic diversity of diploid Arabidopsis arenosa, a little-known member of the plant model genus that occupies a wide niche range from sea level to alpine peaks across eastern temperate Europe. While the northern Balkans hosted one isolated endemic lineage, most of the genetic diversity was concentrated further north in the Pannonian Basin and the Carpathians, where it likely survived the last glaciation in northern refugia. Finally, a distinct postglacial environment in northern Europe was colonized by populations of admixed origin from the two Carpathian lineages. Niche differentiation along altitude-related bioclimatic gradients was the main trend in the phylogeny of A. arenosa. The most prominent niche shifts, however, characterized genetically only slightly divergent populations that expanded into narrowly defined alpine and northern coastal postglacial environments. Our study highlights the role of eastern central European mountains not only as refugia for unique temperate diversity but also sources for postglacial expansion into novel high-altitude and high-latitude niches. Knowledge of distinct genetic substructure of diploid A. arenosa also opens new opportunities for follow-up studies of this emerging model of evolutionary biology.","[""Arabidopsis"",""Balkan Peninsula"",""Ecosystem"",""Europe, Eastern"",""Genetics, Population"",""Microsatellite Repeats"",""Phylogeny"",""Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide"",""Refugium""]","[""approximate Bayesian computation"",""Arabidopsis"",""niche differentiation"",""phylogeography"",""RADseq""]",10.1111/mec.13721,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027932645,,0

On the so-called moral approach, human rights are a special class of moral rights we all possess simply by virtue of our common humanity and which are universal in time and space. By contrast, the political approach instead seeks to understand what human rights are by interpreting the role they play in international affairs as a distinctly modern international legal-political practice that regulates the relationship between governments of sovereign states and their citizens, which has emerged through the creation of the international human rights regime since the end of the Second World War. This volume sets out to contribute to this debate and move it ahead by rethinking some of its fundamental premises and by applying it to new and challenging domains, which have previously been understudied. Thus, the book has two main purposes: to extend and enrich the debate about moral and political conceptions as alternative methodological approaches to the philosophy of human rights, and to explore how these approaches speak to pertinent problems in contemporary human rights practice. In this introductory chapter, we first provide an outline of the debate, before we proceed to outline the issues covered in the various chapters. However, let us first say something about the broader relevance of the chapters compiled in this volume. First, the debate on the philosophy of human rights is important because it has normative implications that bear on salient political issues of our time. This is not just because they may be taken to provide normative standards for legitimate statehood and permissible intervention, as some advocates of a political conception would claim. They also influence policies and decisions of a more mundane but still highly political nature. As Andreas Follesdal suggests in his contribution, normative theories of human rights inform political debates about both the legitimacy of international human rights institutions and the jurisprudence of international human rights courts. Hence, how we think of human rights – how to justify them, what rights there are, to whom they belong, what sort of duties they entail and for whom – has important implications for a range of policy areas.",,,10.1017/9781316650134.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048012026,,0

The Australian car fleet, which is responsible for 8% of national greenhouse emissions, is used as a case study. To explore the potential range of costs associated with rapid climate mitigation via the transport sector, the transition is assumed to occur very rapidly (by 2025). The analysis focusses on urban areas, where extensive charging infrastructure is assumed to be made available, including rapid charging facilities. Due to uncertainty over input variables, two “boundary” scenarios were constructed. In the High Cost Scenario, a rapid shift to EVs was found to cost approximately 25% more than the continuing use of ICEs, assessed over the period 2015–2035. However, in the Low Cost Scenario, where costs of EVs (especially batteries) fall more rapidly, EV maintenance costs are at the lower end of projections, and liquid fuel costs at the higher end of projections, a rapid transition to EVs is found to cost approximately the same as the use of ICE vehicles. This suggests that a rapid transition towards EV technologies for urban car travel may offer a cost-effective second-best climate change mitigation strategy. More comprehensive transport sector transformation, including changes in transport and land use policy designed to facilitate mode shift, might further reduce the costs of such a transition.","[""Charging infrastructures"",""Climate change mitigation"",""Electric Vehicles (EVs)"",""Greenhouse emissions"",""Internal combustion engine vehicles"",""Renewable energies"",""Transport and land use"",""Urban transport""]","[""Costs"",""Electric vehicles"",""Greenhouse emissions"",""Renewable energy"",""Urban transport""]",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.07.131,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982663358,,0

This species is used in acute and chronic toxicity tests to assess water and sediment quality; egg hatching success and the survival of the first larval stages are considered endpoints. Toxicity test protocols require a large number of organisms and an appropriate culture system. Eggs stored under conditions that delay hatching could ensure sufficient quantities of biological materials for ecotoxicological tests. In the current study early-spawned eggs were stored at 3 °C (±1) up to 240 days and their hatching success was evaluated on a monthly basis. Our results showed that the percentage of hatching success for eggs stored for 30 days was >80 % and decreased by about 8 % for every 20 days of storage, up to 120 days. A further increase of time in cold storage brought about a significant reduction, in statistical term, of hatching success compared with the control group (43.69 ± 22.19 %). Almost 50 % of eggs hatched or died during the cold storage period, with more than 80 % lost after periods longer than 150 days. To verify the suitability of stored eggs for toxicity test, 48 h acute tests were performed using nickel chloride as a referent toxicant. Eggs stored for 30, 60, 90 and 120 days gave EC50 values ranging from 0.130 to 0.221 mg L−1, similar to the value recorded for early-spawned eggs, suggesting that these eggs can be used for ecotoxicological tests.

A systematic review was conducted to identify the extent and type of community-based agricultural and household interventions aimed at improving food security, health and the household environment in low and middle income countries. Methods: A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases was performed. Key search words were generated reflecting the ""participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes and study design"" approach and a comprehensive search strategy was developed following ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses"" recommendations. Any community-based agricultural and/or household interventions were eligible for inclusion if the focus was to improve at least one of the outcome measures of interest. All relevant study designs employing any of these interventions (alone/in combination) were included if conducted in Low and middle income countries. Review articles, and clinical and occupational studies were excluded. Results: A total of 123 studies were included and grouped into four intervention domains; agricultural (n = 27), air quality (n = 34), water quality (n = 32), and nutritional (n = 30). Most studies were conducted in Asia (39.2 %) or Africa (34.6 %) with the remaining 26.1 % in Latin America. Very few studies (n = 11) combined interventions across more than one domain. The majority of agricultural and nutritional studies were conducted in Africa and Asia, whereas the majority of interventions to improve household air quality were conducted in Latin America. Conclusions: It is clear that very little trans-disciplinary research has been done with the majority of studies still being discipline specific. It also appears that certain low and middle income countries seem to focus on domain-specific interventions. The review emphasizes the need to develop holistic, cross-domain intervention packages. Further investigation of the data is being conducted to determine the effectiveness of these interventions and whether interdisciplinary interventions provide greater benefit than those that address single health or community problems.","[""Africa"",""Air Pollution, Indoor"",""Asia"",""Developing Countries"",""Environmental Exposure"",""Family Characteristics"",""Food Supply"",""Household Articles"",""Humans"",""Income"",""Nutritional Status"",""Risk Assessment""]","[""Agriculture"",""Food security"",""Health"",""Household air pollution"",""Intervention"",""Nutrition"",""Water quality""]",10.1186/s12889-016-3731-4,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992206034,https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889-016-3731-4,0

This study aims to evaluate the performances of probabilistic daily reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) forecasts with lead times up to 5 days and a spatial resolution of 7 km, computed by using COSMO-LEPS outputs (provided by the European Consortium for small–scale modelling, COSMO), in a region of southern Italy known for its complex topography in proximity to the Mediterranean coastline. ET0 was estimated by means of three different estimation methods, i.e. the Hargreaves-Samani (HS), Priestley-Taylor (PT) and FAO Penman-Monteith (PM) equations, in order to assess the size of the weather forecast errors with models of different accuracies. Forecasts were verified with ground-based data from 18 automatic weather stations, and for two irrigation seasons. Performances were assessed with both deterministic indices, including BIAS, RMSE, correlation coefficients and coefficients of variation of the 16-member ensemble forecasts, and probabilistic metrics, such as the Brier skill score, reliability diagrams and relative operating characteristic. ET0 forecasts with PM equation were robust and reliable, with slight sensitivity to the forecast lead time. High performances were also achieved with HS and PT equations, except for locations close to the coastline, where large systematic errors affect the numerical weather forecasts.","[""Ensemble"",""Limited area models"",""Numerical weather prediction"",""Probabilistic verification"",""Reference evapotranspiration""]","[""Ensemble"",""Limited area models"",""Numerical weather prediction"",""Probabilistic verification"",""Reference evapotranspiration""]",10.1016/j.agwat.2016.09.015,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988476619,,0

The present study investigated (1) whether level of character maturity (low, medium, and high) is associated with amount of aggressive antisocial behaviors (AABs) and psychopathic traits in young men imprisoned for violent criminality, and (2) whether such an association is independent of coexisting attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Methods: Swedish males (N = 270, aged 18-25) sentenced to prison for violent and/or sexual criminality in the western region of the Swedish Prison and Probation Service underwent a thorough clinical examination during their incarceration. Data on character maturity, as measured by the character dimensions Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness of the Temperament and Character Inventory, were available for n = 148 subjects and were used to divide these offenders into three groups with low, medium, and high character maturity. These groups were then compared for variables reflecting criminal history, a DSM-IV diagnosis of ADHD, conduct disorder (CD) and substance use disorders (SUD), aggressive behaviors, and psychopathic traits. Results: Character maturity was consistently associated with less AABs and psychopathic personality traits; the group with the highest character maturity showed: (i) a later age at onset of criminality, (ii) a smaller number of prior violent criminal acts, (iii) lower prevalence of ADHD, CD, and SUD, (iv) less self-rated and expert-rated aggressive behaviors, and (v) less psychopathic traits. The association between character maturity and aggressive behaviors/psychopathic personality traits remained even when ADHD was controlled for. The only exception was sexual criminality, where the group with the highest character maturity contained the largest amount of sexual offenders. Conclusion: Higher character maturity appeared to be a protective factor among young male violent offenders, associated with less AABs, suggesting that character maturity is a promising target for treatment interventions for this group of individuals.",,"[""ADHD"",""Aggression"",""Character maturity"",""Criminality"",""Psychopathic traits"",""Young male criminal offenders""]",10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00185,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006380127,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2016.00185/pdf,0

Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Background and objectives: Compression therapy is a mainstay in the causal treatment of patients with venous leg ulcers. It facilitates healing, reduces pain and recurrences, and increases quality of life. Up until now, there is a scarcity of scientific data with respect to the level of care and the specific knowledge of patients with venous leg ulcers. Patients and methods: At first presentation, patients with venous leg ulcers anonymously answered a standardized questionnaire. Participating facilities nationwide included 55 outpatient care services, 32 medical practices, four wound centers, and one specialized care center. Results: Overall, 177 patients (mean age of 69.4; 75.1 % women) participated in the study. The average duration of florid venous leg ulcers was 17 months. With regard to compression therapy, 31.1 % of patients received none; 40.1 % used bandages; 28.8 % used stockings. Of the latter, 13.7 % were treated with compression class III; 67.4 %, with compression class II; and 19.6 %; with compression class I. While 70.6 % put on their stockings after getting out of bed in the morning, 21.1 % wore them day and night. In 39.2 % of individuals, the stockings caused them discomfort. Merely 11.7 % owned a donning device. On average, bandages were worn for 40.7 weeks, and 69 % were used without underpadding. In 2.8 % of patients, ankle and calf circumference was measured to monitor therapeutic success. 45.9 % reported doing leg exercises. Conclusions: Although it is considered a basic therapeutic measure in venous leg ulcers, one-third of all patients received no compression treatment. Moreover, given the long duration of ulcers, adequate product selection and correct use have to be questioned, too.

Local policies are determined by expectations of policy makers about future climate. There are three types of expectations: strong skeptic, weak skeptic and ‘science-based’. Strong skeptics deny human-induced climate change and a possibility of a climate catastrophe. Weak skeptics believe that industrial emissions cause global warming, but deny catastrophic climate change. Science-based policy makers, considering the warning of the scientific community, account for both: human influence on climate and possible catastrophic shifts. Aggregate behavior of policy makers determines the total emission level which influences global climate dynamics.

This is an Open Access article under the CC BY-NC-ND licenseBackground Several international guidelines recommend the consumption of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day, but their intake is thought to be low worldwide. We aimed to determine the extent to which such low intake is related to availability and affordability. Methods We assessed fruit and vegetable consumption using data from country-specific, validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaires in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study, which enrolled participants from communities in 18 countries between Jan 1, 2003, and Dec 31, 2013. We documented household income data from participants in these communities; we also recorded the diversity and non-sale prices of fruits and vegetables from grocery stores and market places between Jan 1, 2009, and Dec 31, 2013. We determined the cost of fruits and vegetables relative to income per household member. Linear random effects models, adjusting for the clustering of households within communities, were used to assess mean fruit and vegetable intake by their relative cost. Findings Of 143 305 participants who reported plausible energy intake in the food frequency questionnaire, mean fruit and vegetable intake was 3·76 servings (95% CI 3·66–3·86) per day. Mean daily consumption was 2·14 servings (1·93–2·36) in low-income countries (LICs), 3·17 servings (2·99–3·35) in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs), 4·31 servings (4·09–4·53) in upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), and 5·42 servings (5·13–5·71) in high-income countries (HICs). In 130 402 participants who had household income data available, the cost of two servings of fruits and three servings of vegetables per day per individual accounted for 51·97% (95% CI 46·06–57·88) of household income in LICs, 18·10% (14·53–21·68) in LMICs, 15·87% (11·51–20·23) in UMICs, and 1·85% (−3·90 to 7·59) in HICs (ptrend=0·0001). In all regions, a higher percentage of income to meet the guidelines was required in rural areas than in urban areas (p<0·0001 for each pairwise comparison). Fruit and vegetable consumption among individuals decreased as the relative cost increased (ptrend=0·00040). Interpretation The consumption of fruit and vegetables is low worldwide, particularly in LICs, and this is associated with low affordability. Policies worldwide should enhance the availability and affordability of fruits and vegetables.

This study provides an interdisciplinary study to investigate the key contributors driving air pollution emissions changes in China from 1997 to 2012, by applying the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index method. The decomposition results are presented in both multiplicative and additive approaches to show the relative and absolute contribution of each factor in affecting emission changes. Changes in total particulate matter emissions are attributed to variations in primary particle, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides emissions. It is manifested that the economic growth effect and energy intensity effect have always been the two key drivers in affecting the changes in air pollutant emissions over the period. The effects of emission efficiency, production structure and population growth contribute less significantly to overall emission changes, and the impacts of different factors vary among different pollutants. Since current strategies and policies in combatting particulate matter emissions are inefficient, this paper provides a guideline for the Chinese Government to deal with the air pollution problem for sustainable development in China.","[""China"",""Divisia index"",""Fine particulate matter"",""Index decomposition analysis"",""Inter-disciplinary studies"",""Nitrogen oxides emission"",""Particulate matter emissions"",""Total particulate matter""]","[""China"",""Divisia index"",""Emission drivers"",""Index decomposition analysis"",""PM2.5""]",10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.093,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988851478,https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/zhu/files/1-s2.0-s0959652616303699-main.pdf,0

In the current study we present additional records of this taxon, expanding its known distribution into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, and provide additional records from Cyprus and the first records from Rhodes Island (Greece). Our specimens were identified through a combination of morphological and molecular methods involving sequencing of ITS and tufA. Locally, C. taxifolia var. distichophylla occurred in high abundances and dominated the benthic community, suggesting that has the potential to become a major pest in the Mediterranean. It was also observed over a very wide depth range, from the sea surface to at least 100 m depth, on a variety of natural soft and hard substrates as well as abandoned fishing nets, suggesting a broad environmental plasticity.

Based on new data from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change archives, we find limited support for these two logics of action. Neither democracies, which, we argue, are more likely to follow a logic of appropriateness, nor vulnerable countries, which are more likely to follow a logic of consequence, organize systematically more press conferences.

The study included 105 children (54 girls) from 12 preschools in Norway. The preschools were randomly assigned to the experimental group with the invented writing program, or the control group with the ordinary program offered to preschoolers. The classroom-based programs (40 sessions) were conducted by the children’s regular teachers. The children’s emergent literacy skills were evaluated using a pre-test, a post-test and a follow-up test 6 months later, and the data were analyzed using latent autoregressive models. The results showed that the invented writing group performed significantly better than the control group on the post-test for the measures of phoneme awareness (d = .54), spelling (d = .65) and word reading (d = .36). Additionally, indirect effects were observed on the delayed follow-up tests on phoneme awareness (d = .45), spelling (d = .48) and word reading (d = .26). In conclusion, we argue that invented writing appeared to smooth the progress of emergent literacy skills in preschool, including the subsequent reading development in school.

Suitably equipped gliders are uniquely placed to observe both the supply through the thermocline and the consumption of oxygen in the bottom layers. A Seaglider was deployed in the shallow (≈ 100 m) stratified North Sea in a region of known low oxygen during August 2011 to investigate the processes regulating supply and consumption of dissolved oxygen below the pycnocline. The first deployment of such a device in this area, it provided extremely high-resolution observations, 316 profiles (every 16 min, vertical resolution of 1 m) of conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD), dissolved oxygen concentrations, backscatter, and fluorescence during a 3-day deployment. The high temporal resolution observations revealed occasional small-scale events (< 200 m or 6 h) that supply oxygenated water to the bottom layer at a rate of 2 ± 1 μmol -3 day-1. Benthic and pelagic oxygen sinks, quantified through glider observations and past studies, indicate more gradual background consumption rates of 2.5 ± 1 μmol -3 day-1. This budget revealed that the balance of oxygen supply and demand is in agreement with previous studies of the North Sea. However, the glider data show a net oxygen consumption rate of 2.8 ± 0.3 μmol -3 day-1, indicating a localized or short-lived (<200 m or 6 h) increase in oxygen consumption rates. This high rate of oxygen consumption is indicative of an unidentified oxygen sink. We propose that this elevated oxygen consumption is linked to localized depocentres and rapid remineralization of resuspended organic matter. The glider proved to be an excellent tool for monitoring shelf sea processes despite challenges to glider flight posed by high tidal velocities, shallow bathymetry, and very strong density gradients. The direct observation of these processes allows more up to date rates to be used in the development of ecosystem models.",,,10.5194/bg-13-1209-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960153767,https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/1209/2016/bg-13-1209-2016.pdf,0

Methods: Currently, there is no national classification of TC in Sweden. In this study, 7 university hospitals (UHs) in Sweden were selected to represent a TC level I or level II. These UHs have similar capabilities as the definition for level I and level II TC in the United States. Major trauma was defined as Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15. A total of 117,730 patients who were transported by road or air ambulance were selected from the Swedish TRaffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA) database between 2007 to 2014. An analysis of the patient characteristics sustaining major trauma in comparison with patients sustaining minor trauma (ISS < 15) was conducted. Major trauma patients transported to a TC versus non-TC were further analysed with respect to injured body region and road user type. Results: Approximately 3% (n = 3, 411) of patients sustained major trauma. Thirty-eight percent of major trauma patients were transported to a TC, and 62% were transported to a non-TC. This results in large proportions of patients with Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 3+ injuries being transported to a non-TC. The number of AIS 3+ head injuries for major trauma patients transported to a TC versus non-TC were similar, whereas a larger number of AIS 3+ thorax injuries were present in the non-TC group. The non-TC major trauma patients had a higher probability of traveling in a car, truck, or bus and to be involved in a crash in a rural location. Conclusions: Our results show that the majority of RTC major trauma patients are transported to a non-TC. This may cause unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

This nationwide study aimed to investigate the burden of comorbidities in patients with NFPA and to examine whether gender influences the outcome. Design: NFPA patients were identified and followed-up from National Registries in Sweden. It was a nationwide, population-based study. Method: Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for comorbidities with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Comorbidities were analysed in all patients, both patients with and without hypopituitarism. Results: Included in the analysis were 2795 patients (1502 men, 1293 women), diagnosed with NFPA between 1987 and 2011. Hypopituitarism was reported in 1500 patients (54%). Mean patient-years at risk per patient was 7 (range 0-25).

Data acquired from large registry-based studies revealed an increase in mortality rates among KS patients when compared with mortality rates among the general population. Among all causes of death, metabolic, cardiovascular, and hemostatic complication seem to play a pivotal role. KS is associated, as are other chromosomal pathologies and genetic diseases, with cardiac congenital anomalies that contribute to the increase in mortality. The aim of the current study was to systematically review the relationships between KS and the cardiovascular system and hemostatic balance. In summary, patients with KS display an increased cardiovascular risk profile, characterized by increased prevalence of metabolic abnormalities including Diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, and alterations in biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. KS does not, however, appear to be associated with arterial hypertension. Moreover, KS patients are characterized by subclinical abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and endothelial function, which, when associated with chronotropic incompetence may led to reduced cardiopulmonary performance. KS patients appear to be at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, attributing to an increased risk of thromboembolic events with a high prevalence of recurrent venous ulcers, venous insufficiency, recurrent venous and arterial thromboembolism with higher risk of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. It appears that cardiovascular involvement in KS is mainly due to chromosomal abnormalities rather than solely on low serum testosterone levels.

Therefore, proper safety distances should be observed in land use planning to ensure target safety levels for both existing and new buildings. In this paper, a quantitative risk assessment procedure is presented for the estimation of the annual probability of direct structural damage to reinforced concrete buildings associated with high-pressure natural-gas pipeline explosions. The procedure is based on Monte Carlo simulation and takes into account physical features of blast generation and propagation, as well as damage to reinforced concrete columns. The natural-gas jet release process and the flammable cloud size are estimated through SLAB one-dimensional integral model incorporating a release rate model. The explosion effects are evaluated by a Multi-Energy Method. Damage to reinforced concrete columns is predicted by means of pressure-impulse diagrams. The conditional probability of damage was estimated at multiple pressure-impulse levels, allowing blast fragility surfaces to be derived at different performance limit states. Finally, blast risk was evaluated and allowed the estimation of minimum pipeline-to-building safety distances for risk-informed urban planning. The probabilistic procedure presented herein may be used for performance-based design/assessment of buildings and to define the path of new natural-gas pipeline networks.","[""Conditional probabilities"",""High pressure natural gas"",""Natural gas transmission pipeline"",""Pressure-impulse diagrams"",""Quantitative risk assessment"",""Reinforced concrete column"",""Safety distances"",""Structural damages""]","[""Explosion"",""Natural gas pipeline"",""Risk assessment"",""Safety distance"",""Structural damage""]",10.1016/j.ress.2015.11.016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954513354,,0

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Septic arthritis is a serious joint disease often caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) has an important role in several infections. We sought to investigate the role of RAGE in staphylococcal septic arthritis and sepsis in mice. Methods Wild-type (WT) and RAGE deficient (RAGE-/-) mice were intra-articularly or intravenously inoculated with an arthritic or septic dose of S. aureus LS-1 strain. Clinical arthritis, weight development and mortality were monitored for 14 days. Serum levels of cytokines, kidney bacterial loads as well as micro-CT and histopathology of the joints were assessed. Results RAGE-/- mice with septic arthritis had significantly lower IL-17A and higher bone mineral density (BMD) compared to the control group. However, no significant differences between the groups were observed regarding the weight loss, the severity and frequency of arthritis, and bacterial loads in the kidneys. In mice with sepsis, the overall mortality rate was similar in RAGE-/- (39%) and in WT mice (45%). However, RAGE-/- mice with sepsis had significantly higher bacterial load in their kidneys compared to the WT controls. In line with data from hematogenous S. aureus arthritis, RAGE deficiency had no impact on arthritis severity in local joint infection. Conclusions Our results indicate that lack of RAGE has no significant impact on septic arthritis. However, RAGE-/- mice had significantly higher BMD compared to WT mice, which coincided with lower IL-17A in RAGE-/- mice.

The study is based on data obtained from a survey conducted with tourists (N = 4336) on the Costa Daurada (Catalonia), a Mediterranean sun and beach resort. The empirical analysis is based on estimations made using a multinomial model of the transport mode chosen by tourists to travel to the Costa Daurada combined with another model that estimated the probability of them using public transport during their stay. The results show that the tourists who arrived by private car were the ones who least used public transport at the destination. This was despite the fact that these tourists had the profile that made them most likely to use this type of transportation. On the other hand, although the tourists who arrived by plane had the profile that made them least likely to use public transport, they were the ones who used it most. It is, therefore, possible to conclude that, in addition to tourist profile, another key factor in deciding whether tourists will use public transport at their destination is whether they will take their own car.",,"[""Coastal destination"",""Public transport"",""Sustainable mobility"",""Tourist mobility"",""Transport mode choice""]",10.3390/su8090908,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990984023,https://doi.org/10.3390/su8090908,0

The CD38 molecule, with its high expression on multiple myeloma cells, appears a suitable target for antibody therapy. Prompted by this, we used three different CD38 antibody sequences to generate second-generation retroviral CD38- chimeric antigen receptor constructs with which we transduced T cells from healthy donors and multiple myeloma patients. We then evaluated the preclinical efficacy and safety of the transduced T cells. Irrespective of the donor and antibody sequence, CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells proliferated, produced inflammatory cytokines and effectively lysed malignant cell lines and primary malignant cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and multi-drug resistant multiple myeloma in a cell-dose, and CD38-dependent manner, despite becoming CD38-negative during culture. CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells also displayed significant anti-tumor effects in a xenotransplant model, in which multiple myeloma tumors were grown in a human bone marrow-like microenvironment. CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells also appeared to lyse the CD38+ fractions of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and to a lesser extent T and B cells but did not inhibit the outgrowth of progenitor cells into various myeloid lineages and, furthermore, were effectively controllable with a caspase-9-based suicide gene. These results signify the potential importance of CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells as therapeutic tools for CD38+ malignancies and warrant further efforts to diminish the undesired effects of this immunotherapy using appropriate strategies.","[""Animals"",""Antigens, CD38"",""Cytokines"",""Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"",""Disease Models, Animal"",""Flow Cytometry"",""Gene Expression"",""Gene Transfer Techniques"",""Genes, Transgenic, Suicide"",""Hematopoietic Stem Cells"",""Humans"",""Immunotherapy"",""Lymphocyte Activation"",""Mice"",""Mice, Knockout"",""Multiple Myeloma"",""Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell"",""Recombinant Fusion Proteins"",""T-Lymphocytes"",""Transduction, Genetic"",""Tumor Burden""]",,10.3324/haematol.2015.137620,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964723093,https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2015.137620,0

METHODS: This retrospective study included 133 patients with type B AASs undergoing TEVAR; PIS was defined as fever >38°C, white blood cells (WBCs) >12.0/nl and C-reactive protein (CRP) >10 mg/dl within 72 h after TEVAR, despite negative blood cultures. Fibrinogen (FBG), D-dimer (D-d) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were also determined. The clinical endpoints were all-cause mortality and a composite of major adverse events (MAEs such as aortic rupture, need for reintervention and all-cause mortality) at follow-up. RESULTS: PIS was diagnosed in 15.8% of patients and was associated with higher peak values of WBC (17.0 ± 5.1 vs 10.6 ± 3.7/nl, P = 0.002), CRP (22.0 ± 5.4 vs 16.8 ± 8.2 mg/dl, P = 0.03), FBG (779 ± 246 vs 639 ± 225 mg/dl, P = 0.046), D-d (1675 ± 605 vs 1048 ± 639 μg/l, P = 0.003) and IL-6 (192 ± 101 vs 84 ± 34 pg/ml, P = 0.03) than non-PIS patients. All-cause mortality did not significantly differ between PIS and non- PIS patients during the index hospitalization (0.0 vs 6.3%; P = 0.60) and at follow-up (18.8 vs 4.9%; P = 0.086). MAEs were more frequent in the PIS than in the non-PIS group (62.5 vs 25.9%; P = 0.004). PIS (hazard ratio [HR] 3.26, P = 0.022), stroke (HR 3.41, P = 0.004), aortic enlargement (HR 6.88, P = 0.001) and partial thrombosis of the false lumen (HR 6.20, P = 0.003) were independent predictors of MAEs. CONCLUSIONS: PIS occurred in 15.8% of patients with AASs without affecting in-hospital outcome.

Trees sequester atmospheric C into biomass and above and belowground litter but may also prime the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM). We compared the influence of Acer pseudoplatanus (Sycamore) and Larix x. europlepsis (Hybrid Larch) on soil C decomposition. Methods: We used natural abundance 13C to partition soil-surface CO2 efflux into root and SOM sources. CO2 was sampled from incubated root-free soil and from live tree roots using in-situ chambers. Combined surface efflux δ13CO2 was measured using dynamic chambers and cavity-ringdown spectroscopy. Results: Under Sycamore, CO2 emissions were dominated (80–90 %) by root respiration. SOM contributed 10–20 % with a mean residence time of centuries. Under Larch, 24–33 % of total CO2 efflux was root respiration, the remainder originating from an SOM pool with a turnover time of decades. Total soil C stocks were similar between the two plot types. Root-respired δ13CO2 was consistently different by c. 2 ‰ between the species. Conclusions: The decomposition rate of soil C and its mean residence time are markedly different under the two tree species.

Condition factor (CF), liver somatic index (LSI), gonad somatic index (GSI) were measured and the activity of the hepatic enzymes ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione reductase GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT) and muscular activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were assessed. PAH metabolites in bile were also analyzed. The most notable finding in the data set was the low EROD activity in eelpouts collected at the relatively polluted region in Germany compared to the other regions, which could be due to an inhibition of the CYP1A-system or to adaptation to chronic exposure of pollutants in this area. Additionally, low AChE activity was noted in the German region in the autumn campaign and low AChE activity detected in the Danish region in the spring campaign. These differences suggest possible season-specific differences in the use and release of AChE-inhibiting chemicals in the Danish and German regions. Clustering of biomarkers on site level indicated a relationship between CF and GSI and suggested that sites with a high CF contained eelpout that put a larger effort into their larvae development. Clustering of the oxidative stress markers GR, GST and CAT on the individual level reflected a possible coordinated regulation of these enzymes. Overall, the results support the importance of taking into account general regional differences and seasonal variation in biomarker activity when monitoring and assessing the effects of pollution. Despite the expected seasonal variation for most of the measured endpoint, several markers (GSI, EROD and CF) vary similarly between all selected sites in both spring and autumn. This suggests that the differences between sites for these endpoints are independent of season.","[""Baltic sea"",""Biomonitoring"",""Clustering analysis"",""Eelpout"",""Pollution effects"",""Acetylcholinesterase"",""Animals"",""Biomarkers"",""Catalase"",""Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1"",""Denmark"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Fishes"",""Germany"",""Glutathione Reductase"",""Glutathione Transferase"",""Seasons"",""Sweden"",""Water Pollution""]","[""Baltic Sea"",""Biomarkers"",""Biomonitoring"",""Clustering analysis"",""Eelpout"",""Pollution effects""]",10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.07.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978304025,,0

Part of the International Seabed Authority (ISA) regulatory requirements are that these contractors undertake environmental research expeditions to their CCZ exploration claims following guidelines approved by the ISA Legal and Technical Commission (ISA, 2010). Section 9 (e) of these guidelines instructs contractors to "". collect data on the sea floor communities specifically relating to megafauna, macrofauna, meiofauna, microfauna, nodule fauna and demersal scavengers"". There are a number of methodological challenges to this, including the water depth (4000-5000 m), extremely warm surface waters (~28 °C) compared to bottom water (~1.5 °C) and great distances to ports requiring a large and long seagoing expedition with only a limited number of scientists. Both scientists and regulators have recently realized that a major gap in our knowledge of the region is the fundamental taxonomy of the animals that live there; this is essential to inform our knowledge of the biogeography, natural history and ultimately our stewardship of the region. Recognising this, the ISA is currently sponsoring a series of taxonomic workshops on the CCZ fauna and to assist in this process we present here a series of methodological pipelines for DNA taxonomy (incorporating both molecular and morphological data) of the macrofauna and megafauna from the CCZ benthic habitat in the recent ABYSSLINE cruise program to the UK-1 exploration claim. A major problem on recent CCZ cruises has been the collection of high-quality samples suitable for both morphology and DNA taxonomy, coupled with a workflow that ensures these data are made available. The DNA sequencing techniques themselves are relatively standard, once good samples have been obtained. The key to quality taxonomic work on macrofaunal animals from the tropical abyss is careful extraction of the animals (in cold, filtered seawater), microscopic observation and preservation of live specimens, from a variety of sampling devices by experienced zoologists at sea. Essential to the long-term iterative building of taxonomic knowledge from the CCZ is an ""end-to-end"" methodology to the taxonomic science that takes into account careful sampling design, at-sea taxonomic identification and fixation, post-cruise laboratory work with bothDNAand morphology and finally a careful sample and data management pipeline that results in specimens and data in accessible open museum collections and online repositories.",,"[""Abyssal"",""Benthos"",""Box-core"",""Clarion-Clipperton Zone"",""Collecting"",""Deep-sea"",""Echinodermata"",""Epibenthic sledge"",""Mollusca"",""Oceanography"",""Polychaeta"",""Sediment""]",10.3390/jmse4010002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053471591,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1312/4/1/2/pdf,0

Hence, we propose a framework that takes advantage of the multiplicity of components of an ecosystem and their contribution to stability. Ecosystem components can range from species or functional groups, to different functional traits, or even the cover of different habitats in a landscape mosaic. We make use of n-dimensional hypervolumes to define ecosystem states and assess how much they shift after environmental changes have occurred. We demonstrate the value of this framework with a study case on the effects of environmental change on Alpine ecosystems. Our results highlight the importance of a multidimensional approach when studying ecosystem stability and show that our framework is flexible enough to be applied to different types of ecosystem components, which can have important implications for the study of ecosystem stability and transient dynamics.","[""Biodiversity"",""Ecology"",""Ecosystem"",""Models, Biological"",""Plants""]","[""Climate change"",""ecosystem stability"",""land-use changes"",""n-dimensional hypervolumes"",""perturbations""]",10.1111/ele.12617,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84974686644,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4975519?pdf=render,0

This partnership took the form of two care innovation units; wards where qualified staff, students and nurse teachers collaborate to integrate care, education, innovation and research. In this article, the care innovation units as learning environments are studied from a student perspective to deepen understandings concerning the conditions that facilitate learning.A secondary analysis of focus groups, held with 216 nursing students over a period of five years, revealed that students are satisfied about the units' learning potential, which is formed by various inter-related and self-reinforcing affordances: co-constructive learning and working, challenging situations and activities, being given responsibility and independence, and supportive and recognisable learning structures. Time constraints had a negative impact on the units' learning potential.It is concluded that the learning potential of the care innovation units was enhanced by realising certain conditions, like learning structures and activities. The learning potential was also influenced, however, by the non-controllable and dynamic interaction of various elements within the context.

The common assumption is that in addition to the perceived climate benefits increasing forest area will also support biodiversity, thus making afforestation a “win-win scenario”. Based on the existing scientific evidences, we show that joined climate and biodiversity benefits are strongly context-dependent and that the outcome of afforestation is often highly questionable. In Europe, grasslands managed at low intensity contribute substantially to biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. However, many of these grasslands have been lost due to abandonment and subsequent spontaneous succession towards woody vegetation, or due to land use intensification. Moreover, grasslands are the ecosystems most often deliberately afforested in the context of EU carbon-centered policies that may thus counteract biodiversity conservation programmes. By reviewing the main EU policies targeting forests and grasslands, we found a striking ambivalence between policies and funding schemes addressing grassland conservation on the one hand (e.g. Habitats Directive, green payments within the Common Agricultural Policy) and those supporting afforestation on the other (e.g. rural development funds). We suggest three measures towards a better harmonization of the European Union policies that target forest and grassland ecosystems: (1) promoting the alignment of the decisions taken across different policy sectors; (2) focusing on the whole range of ecosystem services and biodiversity issues rather than on carbon management only; (3) valuing systems managed at low-intensity for their multifunctionality.",,"[""Afforestation"",""Carbon management"",""Climate change mitigation"",""Common Agricultural Policy"",""Grassland biodiversity"",""Habitats Directive""]",10.1016/j.biocon.2016.08.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84981510544,,0

OBJECTIVE: investigated why the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome components have increased at a different pace in Mexico and Italy, evaluated changes in traditional Mediterranean and Mexican dietary patterns and analysed some socio economic conditions relating with Metabolic Syndrome. METHODS: Using a Food Balance Sheet (FAO), a hierarchical cluster analysis was developed to define dietary patterns for the period 1961 to 2011. The means of each food group from two countries were compared using a Student’s test for independent samples. The observed differences were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Pearson’s (s) correlation was performed to explore the relationship between Human Development and Gross Domestic Product in the following conditions: global overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity in women and men, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. RESULTS: Total energy availability increased in both countries. Energy derived from cereals decreased, whereas energy from fats, foods of animal origin and vegetable oils increased. Unlike Mexico, apparent sugars consumption did not increase in Italy and olive oil was consumed the most.

Knowledge of deep-sea sponge ecology is limited and this leaves us with a fragmented understanding of the ecological roles that sponges play in CWR ecosystems. We present the first study of faunal biodiversity associated with the massive demosponge Spongosorites coralliophaga (Stephens, 1915) that typically colonizes coral debris fields of CWRs. Our study focused on the sessile fauna inhabiting sponges mixed with coral rubble at two contrasting settings in the northeast Atlantic: the shallow inshore (120–190 m water depth) Mingulay Reef Complex (MRC) and the deep offshore (500–1200 m) Logachev Mound (LM) coral province. MRC is dominated by the scleractinian Lophelia pertusa, while LM is dominated by L. pertusa and Madrepora oculata. Nine sponge–coral rubble associations were collected from MRC and four from LM. Measurements of abundance, species richness, diversity, evenness, dry biomass, and composition of sessile fauna on sponge and coral rubble microhabitats were undertaken. Differences in community composition between the two regions were mainly a response to changes in fauna with depth. Fauna composition was also different between sponge and coral rubble within each region. Infauna constituted a minor component of the sponge-associated fauna in MRC but had a higher contribution in LM.

All rights reserved.Nowadays environmental pollution (including water, air, and soil compartments) has reached elevated levels to be of great concern for humans and other living organisms. Therefore several research efforts have been dedicated to find effective, eco-friendly, and possibly low-cost tools to mitigate the pollution and to clean up and restore polluted environments. In this context, enzymes play a vital role and are potent and specialized catalysts able to transform a variety of compounds including environmental pollutants. Moreover, their catalytic capability is so high that also recalcitrant (ie, less or not transformable, at all) compounds can be converted to safer or innocuous final products. Due to their peculiar properties, enzymes have been considered a good alternative to traditional, non-biological cleanup methodologies. Several examples are available in literature on the use of enzymes for the transformation of single or complex mixtures of pollutants. Attempts at their direct utilization for the recovery of polluted bodies have been addressed, as well. Moreover, enzymes may be useful for monitoring of polluted sites, before and after restoration treatments. Enzymes present both advantages and disadvantages with respect to other biological catalysts although limitations still exist for enzyme application at field scale. However, future improvements are possible, envisaging larger applications of these fascinating and precious catalysts.",,"[""Dehalogenases"",""Environment"",""Enzymes"",""Laccases"",""Pollutants"",""Pollution"",""Remediation methodologies"",""Restoration""]",10.1016/B978-0-12-802392-1.00006-X,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017456362,,0

Cancer-specific active immunotherapy is an experimental form of treatment that stimulates the immune system to recognize antigens on the surface of cancer cells. Current experimental approaches in immunotherapy include vaccines, biochemotherapy, and the transfer of adoptive T cells and dendritic cells. Several types of vaccines, including peptide, viral, and dendritic cell vaccines, are currently under investigation for the treatment of melanoma. These treatments have the same goal as drugs that are already used to stimulate the proliferation of T lymphocytes in order to destroy tumor cells; however, immunotherapies aim to selectively attack the tumor cells of each patient. In this comprehensive review, we describe recent advancements in the development of immunotherapies for melanoma, with a specific focus on the identification of neoantigens for the prediction of their elicited immune responses.

American Geophysical Union. All rights reserved.Chlorine atoms (Cl) are highly reactive toward hydrocarbons in the Earth’s troposphere, including the greenhouse gas methane (CH4). However, the regional and global CH4 sink from Cl is poorly quantified as tropospheric Cl concentrations ([Cl]) are uncertain by ~2 orders of magnitude. Here we describe the addition of a detailed tropospheric chlorine scheme to the TOMCAT chemical transport model. The model includes several sources of tropospheric inorganic chlorine (Cly), including (i) the oxidation of chlorocarbons of natural (CH3Cl, CHBr2Cl, CH2BrCl, and CHBrCl2) and anthropogenic (CH2Cl2, CHCl3, C2Cl4, C2HCl3, and CH2ClCH2Cl) origin and (ii) sea-salt aerosol dechlorination. Simulations were performed to quantify tropospheric [Cl], with a focus on the marine boundary layer, and quantify the global significance of Cl atom CH4 oxidation. In agreement with observations, simulated surface levels of hydrogen chloride (HCl), the most abundant Cly reservoir, reach several parts per billion (ppb) over polluted coastal/continental regions, with sub-ppb levels typical in more remote regions. Modeled annual mean surface [Cl] exhibits large spatial variability with the largest levels, typically in the range of 1-5×104 atoms cm-3, in the polluted northern hemisphere. Chlorocarbon oxidation provides a tropospheric Cly source of up to ~4320 Gg Cl/yr, sustaining a background surface [Cl] of <0.1 to 0.5 × 103 atoms cm-3 over large areas. Globally, we estimate a tropospheric methane sink of ~12-13 Tg CH4/yr due the CH4 + Cl reaction (~2.5% of total CH4 oxidation). Larger regional effects are predicted, with Cl accounting for ~10 to >20% of total boundary layer CH4 oxidation in some locations.",,,10.1002/2016JD025756,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007270904,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2016JD025756,0

The European LIFE ECOREMED project is now implementing an ecocompatible protocol for soil restoration through phytoremediation in Litorale Domitio - Agro Aversano NIPS (South Italy, Campania region). Populus nigra (P. nigra) is among the fastest-growing trees among the short rotation coppice with an annual dry matter production of 17.8 Mg ha-1 y-1. Poplar trees, though not hyperaccumulators, are effective in uptaking PTEs from a very deep layer due to the efficiency of their root systems. However, after soil restoration, the problem of a safe disposal of the contaminated biomasses should be faced. Pyrolysis could be an eco-sustainable post-processing treatment capable to reduce the mass of the contaminated biomass, concentrate the PTEs in the residual char and produce a vapor phase heavy metal free energy carrier. In addition there are many possibilities for valorizing char as fuel in traditional and advanced power generation facilities, in the agronomic field for carbon sequestration and as fertilizer, as contaminant adsorbent in wastewater and soil, as adsorbent or catalyst for gas cleaning, as catalyst for syngas conversion to liquid hydrocarbons and biodiesel production, as raw material for supercapacitors and, finally, as filler in wood and polymer composites. The stability of PTEs and the physico-chemical properties of the produced chars are relevant to assess if such material could be converted into a valuable resource. Steam assisted pyrolysis tests of P. nigra, contaminated by Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn, have been conducted under slow pyrolysis conditions. The effect of the pyrolysis final temperature has been investigated in the temperature range 653-873 K in order to study the distribution of heavy metals in the pyrolysis products. The results show that the concentration of the metals in the chars along the temperature has a non-monotonous trend for P. nigra branches. The maximum concentration of Cd and Pb is measured in the chars produced at 653 K and 753 K, respectively. In chars derived from leaves Cd concentration shows the same trend as in branches, whereas the concentration of Cu, Pb, Zn increases in the whole temperature range. The metals recovery in the chars slightly decreases with temperature in all the examined cases, except for Cd that show a quite complete devolatilization even at temperature higher than 753 K.","[""Biodiesel production"",""Carbon sequestration"",""Dry matter production"",""Liquid hydrocarbons"",""Maximum concentrations"",""Physicochemical property"",""Potentially toxic elements"",""Short rotation coppice""]",,10.3303/CET1758085,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85026370405,,0

Background CTO is present in many patients with coronary artery disease and is difficult to treat with percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods The study population consisted of all consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography in Sweden between January 1, 2005 and January 1, 2012, who were registered in SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry). The patient population was heterogeneous with regard to indication for angiography (stable angina, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], unstable angina or non-STEMI, and other) and treatment options. The long-term mortality rates of patients with and without CTO were compared by using shared frailty Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for confounders. Tests were conducted for interactions between CTO and several pre-specified characteristics: indication for angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (stable angina, STEMI, unstable angina or non-STEMI, and other), severity of coronary artery disease (1-, 2-, and 3-vessel and/or left main coronary artery disease), age, sex, and diabetes. Results During the study period, 14,441 patients with CTO and 75,431 patients without CTO were registered in SCAAR. CTO was associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.22 to 1.37; p < 0.001). In subgroup analyses, the risk attributable to CTO was lowest in patients with stable angina and highest in those with STEMI. In addition, CTO was associated with highest risk in patients under 60 years of age and with lowest risk in octogenarians. There was no interaction between CTO and either diabetes or sex, suggesting an equally adverse effect in both groups. Conclusions In this large prospective observational study of patients with coronary artery disease, CTO was associated with increased mortality. This association was most prominent in younger patients and in those with acute coronary syndromes.","[""Acute Coronary Syndrome"",""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Age Factors"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Angina, Stable"",""Angina, Unstable"",""Angioplasty"",""Chi-Square Distribution"",""Child"",""Child, Preschool"",""Chronic Disease"",""Coronary Angiography"",""Coronary Occlusion"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Infant"",""Infant, Newborn"",""Kaplan-Meier Estimate"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Multivariate Analysis"",""Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction"",""Predictive Value of Tests"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Prospective Studies"",""Registries"",""Risk Factors"",""ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction"",""Sweden"",""Time Factors"",""Treatment Outcome"",""Young Adult""]","[""acute coronary syndrome(s)"",""chronic total occlusion"",""coronary artery disease"",""percutaneous coronary intervention"",""SCAAR""]",10.1016/j.jcin.2016.04.031,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992144610,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcin.2016.04.031,0

As preventive strategies are largely ineffective, threatened preterm labor is a frequent problem that affects approximately 10 % of pregnancies. In recent years, risk assessment in these women has incorporated cervical length measurement and fetal fibronectin testing, and this has improved the capacity to identify women at increased risk for delivery within 14 days. Despite these improvements, risk for preterm birth continues to be increased in women who did not deliver after an episode of threatened preterm labor, as indicated by a preterm birth rate between 30 to 60 % in this group of women. Currently no effective treatment is available. Studies on maintenance tocolysis and progesterone have shown ambiguous results. The pessary has not been evaluated in women with threatened preterm labor, however studies in asymptomatic women with a short cervix show reduced rates of preterm birth rates as well as perinatal complications. The APOSTEL VI trial aims to assess the effectiveness of a cervical pessary in women who did not deliver within 48 h after an episode of threatened preterm labor. Methods/Design: This is a nationwide multicenter open-label randomized clinical trial. Women with a singleton or twin gestation with intact membranes, who were admitted for threatened preterm labor, at a gestational age between 24 and 34 weeks, a cervical length between 15 and 30 mm and a positive fibronectin test or a cervical length below 15 mm, who did not deliver after 48 h will be eligible for inclusion. Women will be allocated to a pessary or no intervention (usual care). Primary outcome is preterm delivery < 37 weeks. Secondary outcomes are amongst others a composite of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Sample size is based on an expected 50 % reduction of preterm birth before 37 weeks (two-sided test, α 0.05 and β 0.2). Two hundred women with a singleton pregnancy need to be randomized. Analysis will be done by intention to treat. Discussion: The APOSTEL VI trial will provide evidence whether a pessary is effective in preventing preterm birth in women who did not deliver 48 h after admission for threatened preterm labor and who remain at high risk for preterm birth.

This empirical relationship, known in the economic literature as the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis, suggests that the relationship between these variables, in the long run, follows an inverse U-shape, that is, from a certain level of per-capita income, an increased economic growth would be accompanied by improvements in environmental quality. Although this hypothesis has been studied since the 1990s, its empirical validity has recently been questioned on the basis of, among other things, the lack of diagnosis of the stationarity properties of the variables, and in a panel data context, the presence of cross-sectional dependence. Taking into account both criticisms, we use recent unit root tests and cointegration techniques that are robust to the presence of cross-sectional dependence. We find contradictory results depending on the assumption of cross-dependence. Under the assumption of cross-independence, the existence of an EKC with a realistic turning point is confirmed. However, this assumption is subsequently rejected, and because of the presence of cross-dependence in the panel, a long-run equilibrium relationship between the variables cannot be established, and we reject the existence of an EKC.",,"[""Carbon dioxide emissions"",""Cointegration"",""Cross-section dependency"",""Environmental Kuznets Curve"",""Latin America and the Caribbean"",""Panel data"",""Unit root""]",10.20937/ATM.2017.30.02.02,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029802836,https://www.revistascca.unam.mx/atm/index.php/atm/article/download/ATM.2017.30.02.02/46587,0

However, the risk of implementing unilateral policies is that distortive effects are generated at the global scale affecting world energy prices, international competitiveness and the geographical allocation of carbon intensive production processes. Using a dynamic CGE model, we assess the rate of carbon leakage and adverse impacts on competitiveness in a number of scenarios over the period 2010-2050. According to the model results, we highlight two major issues. First, in the case of a unilateral EU climate policy, carbon leakage and negative effects on competitiveness are quite serious. Anti-leakage measures can only mitigate leakage and adverse economic impacts on competitiveness in a limited way.

Among the multitude of reasons discussed so far for the lack of observed effects is too short of a time span between implementation and monitoring. Yet, studies that explicitly focus on the importance of restoration age are rare.We present a comprehensive study based on 44 river restoration projects in Germany, focusing on standardized benthic invertebrate sampling. A broad gradient ranging from 1 to 25 years in restoration age was available. In contrast to clear improvements in habitat heterogeneity, benthic community responses to restoration were inconsistent when compared to control sections. Taxon richness increased in response to restoration, but abundance, diversity and various assessment metrics did not respond clearly. Restoration age was a poor predictor of community composition and community change, as no significant linear responses could be detected using 34 metrics. Moreover, only 5 out of 34 tested metrics showed non-linear shifts at restoration ages of 2 to 3 years. This might be interpreted as an indication of a post-restoration disturbance followed by a re-establishment of pre-restoration conditions. BIO-ENV analysis and fourth-corner modeling underlined the low importance of restoration age, but revealed high importance of catchment-scale characteristics (e.g., ecoregion, catchment size and land use) in controlling community composition and community change.Overall, a lack of time for community development did not appear to be the ultimate reason for impaired benthic invertebrate communities. Instead, catchment-scale characteristics override the effectiveness of restoration. To enhance the ecological success of future river restoration projects, we recommend improving water quality conditions and catchment-scale processes (e.g., connectivity and hydrodynamics) in addition to restoring local habitat structure.","[""Macroinvertebrates"",""Revitalization"",""Species traits"",""Stream"",""Time effect"",""Animals"",""Ecology"",""Environmental Restoration and Remediation"",""Germany"",""Invertebrates"",""Rivers"",""Water Quality""]","[""Macroinvertebrates"",""Revitalization"",""Species traits"",""Stream"",""Time effect""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.03.120,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961958960,,0

In other words, they are regenerated at the same speed at which they are consumed, and they are freely available. In the new millennium, we find multiple typologies of renewable energies, such as the sun and wind. The latter has undergone tremendous development and evolution owing both to economic and financial incentives and the increased concern with environmental protection. Initially, the integration of wind power into daily life was very difficult because the first power plants were very large, which caused great anxiety around the world - the so-called Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) problem. For this reason the idea of a wind plant evolved into a softer idea which has brought both change in daily life and the respect for morphology, urbanism and city architecture. In Europe, wind energy has increased in use and quality more than in the USA. Germany and Denmark are the largest producers of wind energy, thanks to the quantity of the available rural spaces but also to effective policies, including permanent government subsidies. In Italy, in contrast, the wind energy boom occurred in the late 1990s. However, the country is reaching the standards of other European countries through widespread installations in Puglia, Sicily and Campania. But so far, we have made reference only to megawatt or multi-megawatt plants which are installed outside urban areas or in sufficiently hilly plains. A micro wind plant is different because it can be installed in an urban setting and inside buildings thanks to the advanced technology and reduced dimensions. A case study of micro wind power in the new scenario is the case proposed here of Sant’Arsenio in Campania. It is a small and uninhabited village which would allow the installation of equipment because of the open green spaces.

In eight pairs of restored–unrestored reaches and floodplains across Europe, we quantified provisioning (agricultural products, wood, reed for thatching, infiltrated drinking water), regulating (flooding and drainage, nutrient retention, carbon sequestration) and cultural (recreational hunting and fishing, kayaking, biodiversity conservation, appreciation of scenic landscapes) services for separate habitats within each reach, and summed these to annual economic value normalized per reach area. We used locally available data and literature, did surveys among inhabitants and visitors, and used a range of economic methods (market value, shadow price, replacement cost, avoided damage, willingness-to-pay survey, choice experiment) to provide final monetary service estimates. Total ecosystem service value was significantly increased in the restored reaches (difference 1400 ± 600 € ha−1 year−1; 2500 − 1100, p = 0.03, paired t test). Removal of one extreme case did not affect this outcome. We analysed the relation between services delivered and with floodplain and catchment characteristics after reducing these 23 variables to four principal components explaining 80% of the variance. Cultural and regulating services correlated positively with human population density, cattle density and agricultural N surplus in the catchment, but not with the fraction of arable land or forest, floodplain slope, mean river discharge or GDP.

It provides an innovative contribution to the literature by refining our knowledge of how public perceptions on the oceans vary significantly by country, region and by demographic variables such as age and gender. Four issues emerge as important from this survey: (1) Concern about the oceans is variable but generally below other environmental concerns in different countries; (2) Ecosystem services, in particular regulatory, cultural and provisioning services that have broader societal relevance are recognised as important by the public; (3) There is a schism between scientific and public perspectives on the key pressures that affect marine systems; and (4) demographic factors such as age or generation can influence perceptions on marine issues more than the proximity of a community to the coastal environment. Public viewpoints on the oceans will play an important, if yet undetermined, role in supporting reforms such as marine planning, the large scale deployment of marine renewables and marine protected areas that have significant social and economic consequences.",,"[""Ecosystem approach"",""European marine environment"",""Marine values"",""Public perceptions""]",10.1016/j.marpol.2016.06.012,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975810919,,0

However, the causal connection between myocardial infarctions and atherosclerotic plaque rupture events in the coronary arteries has not been investigated so far. The objective of this study was to assess whether diet-induced coronary plaque ruptures trigger atherothrombotic occlusions, resulting in myocardial infarctions in HFC-fed HypoE/SRBI-/- mice. Methods: HypoE/SRBI-/- mice were characterized with respect to the individual dynamics of myocardial infarctions and features of infarct-related coronary atherosclerosis by serial noninvasive molecular and functional imaging, histopathology, and a pharmaceutical intervention. Detailed histologic analysis of whole mouse hearts was performed when spontaneously occurring acute myocardial infarctions were diagnosed by imaging. Results: Using the imaging-Triggered approach, we discovered thrombi in 32 (10.8%) of all 296 atherosclerotic coronary plaques in 14 HFC-fed HypoE/SRBI-/- mice. These thrombi typically were found in arteries presenting with inflammatory plaque phenotypes. Acetylsalicylic acid treatment did not attenuate the development of atherosclerotic coronary plaques but profoundly reduced the incidence of premature deaths, the number of thrombi (7 in 249 plaques), and also the degree of inflammation in the culprit lesions. Conclusion: HFC-induced ruptures of coronary plaques trigger atherothrombosis, vessel occlusions, myocardial infarctions, and sudden death in these mice. Thus, the HypoE/SRBI-/- mouse model mimics major features of human coronary heart disease and might therefore be a valuable model for the investigation of molecular and cellular parameters driving plaque rupture-related events and the development of new interventional approaches.","[""Animals"",""Coronary Thrombosis"",""Diagnostic Imaging"",""Female"",""Male"",""Mice"",""Mice, Knockout"",""Myocardial Infarction"",""Plaque, Atherosclerotic"",""Rupture, Spontaneous""]","[""Aspirin"",""Atherosclerosis"",""Hyperlipidemicmouse model"",""Imaging"",""Plaque vulnerability"",""Thrombosis""]",10.2967/jnumed.115.171132,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989298240,http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/57/9/1420.full.pdf,0

Solanum pennellii is a wild tomato species that exhibits a higher water use efficiency compared with cultivated S. lycopersicum. In particular, a cultivated line carrying a small S. pennellii region on chromosome 9 (IL 9-2-5) was identified as more tolerant to water deficit. In this work, the tolerant (IL 9-2-5) and the susceptible (M82) genotypes were subjected to three different water regimes: irrigation with 100% (V1), 50% (V2) and 25% (V3) field capacity. To evaluate the physiological response of IL 9-2-5 and M82 to water deficit, leaf functional traits, plant biomass production and maximal PSII photochemical efficiency were measured together with photosynthetic pigments and phenolic compounds. The higher tolerance to water deficiency of IL 9-2-5 was associated with the development of a better antioxidant system, especially in treatment V3. In addition, IL 9-2-5 had higher values of sclerophylly and leaf dry matter content thus confirming that the tolerance of IL 9-2-5 can be attributed to traits related to leaf morphology and physiology. In future, identification of polymorphisms in key-genes controlling these traits can guide breeding efforts aimed at improving susceptible genotypes.",,"[""Functional leaf traits"",""Phenolics"",""Photochemical efficiency"",""Tomato introgression lines"",""Water stress""]",10.1080/11263504.2014.989286,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84916919888,,0

Excessive bleeding after cardiac surgical procedures sometimes necessitates reexploration. This study described the associations between reexploration for bleeding and morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgical procedures. In addition, independent predictors of reexploration were identified. Methods. This retrospective observational study based on prospectively registered data included 5,392 consecutive cardiac surgical operations performed from 2009 through 2013. Reexplorations for bleeding within 24 hours of surgical procedures and perioperative morbidity and mortality (30-day, 90-day, and from 90 days until the end of follow-up) were registered. Factors independently associated with mortality, morbidity, and reexploration were identified with multivariable logistic or Cox regression models. Mean follow-up time was 2.4 years (range 0 to 5 years). Results. In this study, 320 patients (6.0%) underwent surgical reexploration. These patients had higher unadjusted mortality at 30 days, 90 days, and more than 90 days (all p < 0.0001). The increased risk remained statistically significant after adjustment for other risk factors at 90 days (odds ratio [OR]: 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13 to 2.93; p = 0.013) and at more than 90 days (hazard ratio: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.61; p = 0.010). Reexploration was, after adjustment, independently associated with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (>24 hours), perioperative stroke, perioperative renal injury, need for dialysis postoperatively, prolonged mechanical ventilation (>72 hours), and postoperative mechanical circulation support. Independent risk factors for reexploration were low body mass index, high EuroSCORE, low preoperative fibrinogen plasma concentration, long extracorporeal circulation time, combined valve and coronary artery bypass operations, and dual antiplatelet therapy less than 5 days preoperatively. Conclusions. Excessive bleeding leading to reexploration is associated with a twofold increased early postoperative mortality rate. Reexploration for bleeding is also associated with mortality beyond 90 days after operation.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"",""Child"",""Female"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""Humans"",""Incidence"",""Intensive Care Units"",""Length of Stay"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Odds Ratio"",""Postoperative Hemorrhage"",""Prognosis"",""Reoperation"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Factors"",""Survival Rate"",""Sweden"",""Time Factors"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.01.006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961773386,http://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003497516000072/pdf,0

All rights reserved.In Europe as a whole, survival from skin malignant melanoma (SMM) has increased constantly since the 1980s. The aim of the SUDCAN collaborative study was to compare the trends in the 5-year net survival from SMM and in related excess mortality rate between six European Latin countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland). The data were extracted from the EUROCARE-5 database (end of follow-up: 01 January 2009). First, the net survival was studied over the 2000-2004 period using the Pohar-Perme estimator. For trend analyses, the study period was specific to each country. The results are reported from 1992 to 2004 in France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland and from 2000 to 2004 in Belgium and Portugal. The analyses were carried out using a flexible excess rate modeling. Over the 2000-2004 period, the 5-year net survival from SMM ranged from 79 (Portugal) to 90% (Switzerland). In all countries, net survival was higher in women versus men and in young versus old age groups. From 1992 to 2004, the 5-year net survival increased the most in the countries with the lowest survivals in 1992 (+9% in Italy and Spain vs. +2% in Switzerland or +4% in France). The differences between countries decreased between 1992 and 2004. Although survival increased to a lower or higher extent in all countries during the period studied, significant differences in net survival from SMM persisted among the six countries studied. Health policies should mainly enhance early diagnosis by increasing public awareness and with screening campaigns. Furthermore, new immunotherapies, which will be approved soon hopefully, should also be used to improve the outcomes of SMM treatment.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Belgium"",""Databases, Factual"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""France"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Male"",""Melanoma"",""Middle Aged"",""Population Surveillance"",""Portugal"",""Registries"",""Skin Neoplasms"",""Spain"",""Survival Rate"",""Switzerland"",""Young Adult""]","[""Cancer registries"",""Europe"",""Excess mortality rate"",""Latin countries"",""Net survival"",""Skin melanoma"",""Trend analysis""]",10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000306,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010194121,,0

Therefore, assessing their energy consumption requires precise models. In the past years, many models targeting different hardware components, such as CPU, storage and network interface cards (NIC) have been proposed. However, most of them neglect energy consumption related to VM migration. Since VM migration is a network-intensive process, to accurately model its energy consumption we also need energy models for network transfers, comprising their complete software stacks with different energy characteristics. In this work, we present a comparative analysis of the energy consumption of the software stack of two of today's most used NICs in data centres, Ethernet and Infiniband. We carefully design for this purpose a set of benchmark experiments to assess the impact of different traffic patterns and interface settings on energy consumption. Using our benchmark results, we derive an energy consumption model for network transfers. Based on this model, we propose an energy consumption model for VM migration providing accurate predictions for paravirtualised VMs running on homogeneous hosts. We present a comprehensive analysis of our model on different machine sets and compare it with other models for energy consumption of VM migration, showing an improvement of up to 24% in accuracy, according to the NRMSE error metric.","[""Accurate prediction"",""Benchmark experiments"",""Comparative analysis"",""Comprehensive analysis"",""Energy consumption model"",""Network interface cards"",""Reducing energy consumption"",""Virtual machine migrations""]","[""Benchmarking"",""Energy consumption"",""Network interface card"",""Virtual machine migration""]",10.1016/j.future.2015.07.007,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958750051,http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/3971/1/fgcs-post-refereeing-final-07072015.pdf,0

Particulate matter (PM2.5) metrics applied to second hand smoke (SHS) concentrations provide indoor air quality (IAQ) measurements and have been used to promote smoking behaviour change among parents of young children. Here, we present the qualitative results from a study designed to use IAQ measurements to help pregnant women who smoke to quit smoking. Methods: We used IAQ measurements in two centres (Aberdeen and Coventry) using two interventions: 1. In Aberdeen, women made IAQ measurements in their homes following routine ultrasound scan; 2. In Coventry, IAQ measurements were added to a home-based Stop Smoking in Pregnancy Service. All women were invited to give a qualitative interview to explore acceptability and feasibility of IAQ measurements to help with smoking cessation. A case study approach using grounded theory was applied to develop a typology of pregnant women who smoke. Results: There were 39 women recruited (18 in Aberdeen and 21 in Coventry) and qualitative interviews were undertaken with nine of those women. Diverse accounts of smoking behaviours and experiences of participation were given. Many women reported changes to their smoking behaviours during pregnancy. Most women wanted to make further changes to their own behaviour, but could not commit or felt constrained by living with a partner or family members who smoked. Others could not envisage quitting. Using themes emerging from the interviews, we constructed a typology where women were classified as follows: 'champions for change'; 'keen, but not committed'; and 'can't quit, won't quit'. Three women reported quitting smoking alongside participation in our study. Conclusions: Pregnant women who smoke remain hard to engage,. Although providing IAQ measurements does not obviously improve quit rates, it can support changes in smoking behaviour in/around the home for some individuals. Our typology might offer a useful assessment tool for midwives.","[""Adult"",""Air Pollution, Indoor"",""Female"",""Grounded Theory"",""Humans"",""Motivation"",""Pregnancy"",""Pregnancy Complications"",""Pregnant Women"",""Qualitative Research"",""Smoking"",""Smoking Cessation"",""Tobacco Smoke Pollution"",""United Kingdom""]","[""Behaviour change"",""Child health"",""Indoor air quality (IAQ)"",""Pregnancy"",""Qualitative health research"",""Second hand smoke (SHS)"",""Smoking cessation services""]",10.1186/s12884-016-1062-1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990940956,https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12884-016-1062-1,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution.The higher termites (Termitidae) are keystone species and ecosystem engineers. They have exceptional biomass and play important roles in decomposition of dead plant matter, in soil manipulation, and as the primary food for many animals, especially in the tropics. Higher termites are most diverse in rainforests, with estimated origins in the late Eocene (54 Ma), postdating the breakup of Pangaea and Gondwana when most continents became separated. Since termites are poor fliers, their origin and spread across the globe requires alternative explanation. Here, we show that higher termites originated 42-54Ma in Africa and subsequently underwent at least 24 dispersal events between the continents in two main periods. Using phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial genomes from 415 species, including all higher termite taxonomic and feeding groups, we inferred 10 dispersal events to South America and Asia 35-23Ma, coinciding with the sharp decrease in global temperature, sea level, and rainforest cover in the Oligocene. After global temperatures increased, 23-5Ma, there was only one more dispersal to South America but 11 to Asia and Australia, and one dispersal back to Africa. Most of these dispersal events were transoceanic and might have occurred via floating logs. The spread of higher termites across oceans was helped by the novel ecological opportunities brought about by environmental and ecosystem change, and led termites to become one of the few insect groups with specialized mammal predators. This has parallels with modern invasive species that have been able to thrive in humanimpacted ecosystems.","[""Animal Distribution"",""Animals"",""DNA, Mitochondrial"",""Ecosystem"",""Genome, Mitochondrial"",""Introduced Species"",""Isoptera"",""Mitochondria"",""Phylogeny"",""Phylogeography"",""Rainforest""]","[""Historical biogeography"",""Insects"",""Isoptera""]",10.1093/molbev/msw253,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019848181,https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article-pdf/34/3/589/10821677/msw253.pdf,0

They have been the most abundant and continuous fossil record over the last 215 million years (Myr), offering great potential for geochemical studies, although the heterococcolith fossil record remains underutilised in this domain. We have mapped heterococcoliths' composition using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) with a 100-nm resolution beam to decipher element distributions in heterococcoliths and to investigate the potential development of geochemical proxies for palaeoceanography. The study presents two Middle Jurassic Watznaueria britannica heterococcoliths from Cabo Mondego, Portugal. XRF analysis was performed with a 17 keV incident energy beam at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ID22NI beamline to study elements from Sr down to S. Ca, Sr and Mn are distributed following the heterococcolith crystalline arrangement. Cl, Br and S display an homogeneous distribution, whereas K, Fe, Cu, Zn and Rb are concentrated at the edges and in the central area of the heterococcoliths. Distributions of K, Fe, Ti, Fe, Cu, Zn, Rb and to a lesser extent V and Cr are highly influenced by clay contamination and peripheral diagenetic overgrowth. Mn is related to diagenetic Mn-rich CaCO3 overgrowth on top of or between heterococcoliths shields. Cl and Br are likely to be present in heterococcoliths inside interstitial nano-domains. We assume that the cytoplasm [Cl−] and [Br−] are mediated and constant during heterococcolithogenesis. Assuming a linear correlation between cytoplasm [Cl−] and sea water [Cl−], heterococcolith Cl may have potential as a salinity proxy. As S is incorporated into heterococcoliths by sulphated polysaccharides, our study suggests a role for such polysaccharides in heterococcolithogenesis for at least 170 Myr. The low Sr/Ca in the W. britannica specimens studied here may either highlight an unusual cellular physiology of Mesozoic coccolithophores or result from low growth rates in oligotrophic environments.",,,10.1111/gbi.12177,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975745553,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01419631/file/Manuscript_revised_preprint.pdf,0

Many policy options can be envisioned to achieve such a no-net-loss target, mainly acting on land use and land management. To assess the effectiveness of such policies at a European Union (EU) scale, we simulated land use changes and their impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services indicators. We analysed a Business-as-Usual scenario, and three no-net-loss scenarios. The no-net-loss scenarios included measures that aim to reduce negative impacts of land use change on biodiversity and ecosystem services, by better implementation of existing biodiversity conservation measures (Scenario 1); and enhancement of existing measures (Scenario 2); and offsetting residual impacts on areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem service value (Scenario 3).Results show that none of the scenarios achieved overall no-net-loss. Compared to a Business-as-Usual scenario, the no-net-loss scenarios reduced the overall degree of land cover change at EU level, hence reducing impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services in large parts of the EU. The more comprehensive no-net-loss scenarios resulted in a gain of natural land cover. Moreover, natural areas became better connected, especially in peri-urban areas as a result of impact avoidance and offsetting. Richness of farmland bird species was projected to increase. Measures included in the no-net-loss scenarios had net positive effects on pollination and carbon sequestration, neutral effects on crop production, erosion prevention and flood regulation, and negative effects on nature-based recreation, compared to Business-as-Usual. In particular circumstances policy measures invoked displacement effects in land use allocation, reducing the effectiveness of the measures. This was primarily the case for flood regulation services throughout the EU.This study differentiates the potential effectiveness of a no-net-loss policy framework in three manners: (i) considering biodiversity and ecosystem services simultaneously; (ii) in the light of existing policies and land use pressures; and (iii) in different land use contexts across the EU. Taken together, we conclude that achieving no-net-loss for biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the EU remains challenging given high land use demands. Nevertheless, in large parts of Europe there appears room for improvement for certain kinds of biodiversity and ecosystem services compared to Business-as-Usual, while still meeting other land use demands.",,"[""Biodiversity conservation"",""Biodiversity offsets"",""Environmental policy"",""European union"",""Indicators"",""Land use modelling"",""Land use planning"",""Mitigation hierarchy""]",10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.05.018,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973382106,,0

For this reason, the International Energy Agency defines in its latest publication the improvement of building envelopes as one of the key points to reduce the energy consumption in buildings. In the present study, two sustainable construction systems based on rammed earth walls are adapted to modern requirements to be thermally tested and compared against three Mediterranean conventional systems under summer conditions. The experimentation was done by performing several experiments in free floating and controlled temperature conditions at real scale in five cubicle-shape buildings with inner dimensions 2.4 × 2.4 × 2.4 m. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that more sustainable construction systems can be used instead of conventional ones, with higher embodied energy, and achieve similar thermal response. Results show that the reduction of rammed earth wall thickness strongly penalizes its thermal behavior. However, similar thermal response than conventional systems is reached when 6 cm of wooden insulation panels are added in the outer face of the cubicle-shape building.","[""Controlled temperature"",""Conventional systems"",""Embodied energy"",""International energy agency"",""Rammed earth"",""Sustainable building"",""Sustainable construction"",""Thermal Performance""]","[""Embodied energy"",""Rammed earth"",""Sustainable building"",""Thermal performance"",""Wooden insulation""]",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.05.010,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84965011460,https://repositori.udl.cat/bitstream/10459.1/57823/5/024289.pdf,0

A major challenge in administering timely treatment is determining whether the stroke is due to vascular blockage (ischaemic) or haemorrhage. For patients with ischaemic stroke, thrombolysis (i.e. pharmacological 'clot-busting') can improve outcomes when delivered swiftly after onset, and current National Health Service Quality Improvement Scotland guidelines are for thrombolytic therapy to be provided to at least 80 per cent of eligible patients within 60 min of arrival at hospital. Thrombolysis in haemorrhagic stroke could severely compound the brain damage, so administration of thrombolytic therapy currently requires near-immediate care in a hospital, rapid consultation with a physician and access to imaging services (X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) and intensive care services. This is near impossible in remote and rural areas, and stroke mortality rates in Scotland are 50 per cent higher than in London. We here describe our current project developing a technology demonstrator with ultrasound imaging linked to an intelligent, multi-channel communication device - connecting to multiple 2G/3G/4G networks and/or satellites - in order to stream live ultrasound images, video and two-way audio streams to hospital-based specialists who can guide and advise ambulance clinicians regarding diagnosis. With portable ultrasound machines located in ambulances or general practices, use of such technology is not confined to stroke, although this is our current focus. Ultrasound assessment is useful in many other immediate care situations, suggesting potential wider applicability for this remote support system. Although our research programme is driven by rural need, the ideas are potentially applicable to urban areas where access to imaging and definitive treatment can be restricted by a range of operational factors.","[""Ambulances"",""Communication"",""Emergency Medical Services"",""Hospitals"",""Humans"",""Internet"",""Stroke"",""Telemedicine"",""Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial"",""United Kingdom""]","[""acute stroke emergency treatment"",""medical data and image transfer in remote locations"",""technology-supported diagnosis""]",10.1177/1460458215580353,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84981347271,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/55118/1/Mort_etal_HIJ_2015_Combining_transcranial_ultrasound_with_intelligent_communication_methods_to_enhance_the_remote_assessment_and_management_of_stroke.pdf,0

The participants were 2624 adolescents (1316 boys) aged between 10 and 16 years. Perceived maternal and paternal acceptance–rejection—defined in terms of the framework of interpersonal acceptance–rejection theory—and anxiety–depression symptoms and aggressive behaviors were assessed. The intraclass correlation coefficients were performed to evaluate the impact of inter-parental inconsistency on adolescent adjustment. Moreover, a cluster analysis was used to uncover patterns in combinations of maternal and paternal acceptance–rejection. Our findings show that, in general, adolescents perceive their mothers and fathers as similarly accepting or rejecting. Parental rejection was associated with adolescent maladjustment.

The aim was to assess whether a reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is associated with improved mortality/morbidity in an unselected population of HFmrEF and HFpEF patients. Methods and Results-In the Swedish Heart Failure Registry, HFmrEF (EF=40%-49%) and HFpEF (EF≥50%) patients reporting at least 2 consecutive outpatient NT-proBNP assessments were prospectively studied. Associations between reduction in NT-proBNP and overall mortality, HF hospitalization, and their composite were assessed by multivariable Cox regressions, with NT-proBNP changes modeled as binary (decrease/increase) or quantitative predictor by restricted cubic splines. In 650 patients, at a median of 7 months between the 2 measurements of NT-proBNP and over a median follow-up of 1.65 years, 361 patients (55%) showed a reduction and 289 patients (45%) an increase in NT-proBNP. Change in NT-proBNP was associated with risk of outcomes. Fifty-seven patients (16%) who decreased their NT-proBNP versus 78 patients (27%) who increased it died from any cause (adjusted hazard ratio=0.53; 95% confidence interval=0.36-0.77), 61 (17%) versus 86 (30%) were hospitalized for HF (hazard ratio=0.41; 95% confidence interval=0.29-0.60), and 96 (27%) versus 125 (43%) reported the composite outcome (hazard ratio=0.46; 95% confidence interval=0.34-0.62). These findings were replicated in HFmrEF and HFpEF separately. Conclusions-In HFmrEF and HFpEF during routine care, decreases in NT-proBNP were associated with improved mortality and morbidity. Studies to determine whether NT-proBNP changes in response to therapy predict drug efficacy are needed.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Cause of Death"",""Female"",""Heart Failure"",""Hospitalization"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Mortality"",""Natriuretic Peptide, Brain"",""Peptide Fragments"",""Prognosis"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Prospective Studies"",""Registries"",""Stroke Volume"",""Sweden""]","[""Heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction"",""heart failure with preserved ejection fraction"",""N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide"",""prognosis"",""registry""]",10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.116.003105,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995784243,,0

In this paper we review calibration and validation approaches adopted for recently published applications of land-change models. We found that statistical analyses and automated procedures are the two most common calibration approaches, while expert knowledge, manual calibration, and transfer of parameters from other applications are less frequently used. Validation of model results is predominantly based on locational accuracy assessment, while a small fraction of the applications assessed the accuracy of the generated land-use or land-cover patterns. Of the reviewed model applications, thirty-one percent did not report any validation. We argue that to mature as a scientific tool, and to gain credibility for scenario studies and policy assessments, the validation of land-change models requires consideration of challenges posed by uncertainty, complexity, and non-stationarity of land-change processes, and equifinality and multifinality of land-change models.","[""Land-cover change"",""Land-use change"",""Model accuracy"",""Model development"",""Model evaluation"",""Urban growth modeling""]","[""Land-cover change"",""Land-use change"",""Model accuracy"",""Model development"",""Model evaluation"",""Urban growth model""]",10.1016/j.envsoft.2016.04.017,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964978107,,0

This paper extends the previous logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) decomposition model by introducing three novel factors (R&D intensity, investment intensity, and R&D efficiency). The extended model not only considers the conventional drivers of EICE, but also reflects the microeconomic effects of investment and R&D behaviors on EICE. Furthermore, taking Shanghai as an example, which is the economic center and leading CO2 emitter in China, we use the extended model to decompose and explain EICE changes. Also, we incorporate renewable energy sources into the proposed model to carry out an alternative decomposition analysis at Shanghais entire industrial level. The results show that among conventional (macroeconomic) factors, expanding output scale is mainly responsible for the increase in EICE, and industrial structure adjustment is the most significant factor in mitigating EICE. Regardless of renewable energy sources, the emission-reduction effect of energy intensity focused on by the Chinese government is less than the expected due to the rebound effect, but the introduction of renewable energy sources intensifies its mitigating effect, partly resulting from the transmission from the abating effect of industrial structure adjustment. The effect of energy structure is the weakest. Although all the three novel factors exert significant effects on EICE, they are more sensitive to policy interventions than conventional factors. R&D intensity presents an obvious mitigating effect, while investment intensity and R&D efficiency display an overall promotion effect with some volatility. The introduction of renewable energy sources intensifies the promotion effect of R&D efficiency as a result of the ""green paradox"" effect. Finally, we propose that CO2 mitigation efforts should be made by considering both macroeconomic and microeconomic factors in order to achieve a desirable emission-reduction effect.","[""CO2 emissions"",""Decomposition analysis"",""Industrial structure adjustments"",""Macroeconomic factors"",""Microeconomic factors"",""Policy intervention"",""Renewable energy source"",""Shanghai""]","[""Extended LMDI model"",""Industrial CO2 emissions"",""Investment and R&D activities"",""Macroeconomic factors"",""Microeconomic factors"",""Shanghai""]",10.1016/j.rser.2015.10.081,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84947811839,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/57274/1/Manuscript_2.pdf,0

OBJECTIVE: investigated why the prevalence of Metabolic Syndrome components have increased at a different pace in Mexico and Italy, evaluated changes in traditional Mediterranean and Mexican dietary patterns and analysed some socio economic conditions relating with Metabolic Syndrome. METHODS: Using a Food Balance Sheet (FAO), a hierarchical cluster analysis was developed to define dietary patterns for the period 1961 to 2011. The means of each food group from two countries were compared using a Student’s test for independent samples. The observed differences were analysed using the Mann-Whitney U test. Pearson’s (s) correlation was performed to explore the relationship between Human Development and Gross Domestic Product in the following conditions: global overweight/obesity, abdominal obesity in women and men, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. RESULTS: Total energy availability increased in both countries. Energy derived from cereals decreased, whereas energy from fats, foods of animal origin and vegetable oils increased. Unlike Mexico, apparent sugars consumption did not increase in Italy and olive oil was consumed the most. CONCLUSIONS: Both countries have changed the traditional diet and some correlations between economic conditions and health were statistically significant. Mexico showed a greater disadvantage in socio-economic indicators.

All rights reserved.Psychological disorders can be understood as disorders of affective regulation. Perturbations in affective regulation are not only characterized by specific forms of a patient’s subjective experiences of emotions, but are also observable as typical relationship offers characterized by specific verbal and nonverbal behavior. Therefore, patients with anorexia nervosa have been studied in terms of whether specific interactive relationship patterns could be observed. In our paper, we will first outline our research approach that focuses on the micro-analytic study of nonverbal interactive behavior and, in particular, the facial expressions of emotions. The interactions were videotaped and selected sequences were coded with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). These objectively coded data were then linked to intrapsychic and interactive processes of affective regulation. Using this approach, three different types of dyads have been analyzed. In the first study, interviews with anorexic patients about anger and joy situations were examined. In comparison to a healthy control group, anorexic patients showed nonverbal behaviors, such as reduction of eye contact and simultaneous smiling, that reduce the affective relatedness between persons. The patients also displayed less felt smiles and more masking smiles. In the second study, dyadic interactions between mothers and their adolescent anorexic daughters were investigated. The mothers’ interactive behavior was characterized by very frequent relationship offers such as smiling. The daughters, however, reacted to these relationship offers with strategies of rejection. They averted their gaze, closed their eyes and did not at all respond to their mothers’ intense smiling. There was also a reduction in listener responses such as “mhms” or head nodding. A third study investigated the interactive regulation of guilt feelings between female anorexic patients and their mothers compared to healthy daughters and their mothers. While processes of guilt feeling induction in healthy dyads were mostly initiated by the mothers, in the clinical dyads, guilt feelings were mostly induced by the daughters. Anorexic patients interactively rejected their mothers’ frequent relationship offers and their attempts to regulate inner conflictive feelings. By not relieving the mothers’ guilt feelings, the anorexic daughters remained in the more powerful position and were able to control the situation and retain a certain level of autonomy. We assume that these typical interactive relationship patterns also occur in the therapeutic relationship and manifest themselves in typical processes of transference and counter-transference. Thus, these patterns may become addressed and subsequently changed in the course of psychotherapy.",,"[""Anorexia nervosa"",""Facial expression"",""Facs"",""Interaction studies"",""Interactive relationship patterns"",""Microsequence analysis"",""Nonverbal behavior""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034245410,,0

All rights reserved.Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore, illustrate, and conceptualize how sustainability service is performed and the role it plays in the promotion of sustainable consumption. Design/methodology/approach – Theoretically, this paper takes a practice theory approach, conceptualizing the provision of sustainability service as a set of complex, socio-material, and performative practices. Methodologically, this paper draws on an ethnographic study of a retail chain – W-Store – and its sustainability service. Interviews with management and focus group interviews with shop assistants and consumers, as well as observations made in-store, make up the material analysed. Findings – The provision of sustainability service is accomplished in this case via three service practices; arranging green shopping trails, answering sustainability questions, and promoting sustainability to green consumers in-store. The analysis shows that the retailing of sustainable products is not simply a matter of including sustainability products in the range and instructing shop assistants to promote them. Sustainability service – as enacted at W-Store – was dependent on the successful combination and configuration of human competence (service staff) and IT and organizational artefacts. There also needed to be congruence between consumers and their images and between retailers and the version of sustainability they were enacting. Finally, the provision of sustainability service required an investigative and adaptive organization capable of keeping up as well as developing vis-á-vis changing sustainability discourses and issues. However, once the necessary conditions had been met, sustainability service worked towards promoting sustainable consumption by making green shopping possible, educating consumers on sustainability issues, and motivating them via positive feedback and dialogue. Originality/value – Underscores the importance of investigating sustainability service and offers both a conceptual approach to and an analysis of this particular type of retail service work.",,"[""Green retail"",""Practice theory"",""Service"",""Store"",""Sustainability"",""Sustainable consumption""]",10.1108/IJRDM-06-2015-0092,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968648335,,0

Microbial inoculants mainly include free-living bacteria, fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The aim of the current experiment was to assess the effect of two commercial inoculants containing AMF alone or AMF in combination with plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPR) on yield components and quality of artichoke (Cynara cardunculus subsp. scolymus (L.) Hegi). The micropropagated plants of Romanesco globe artichoke cultivar 'C3' were inoculated at transplanting with a commercial inoculum containing 700 spores g-1 of Rhizophagus intraradices and 700 spores g-1 of Funneliformis mossae at a dose of 2 kg ha-1, whereas another part of the plants was inoculated with a commercial inoculum containing 132 spores g-1of Rhizophagus intraradices and 2×109 CFU g-1 of beneficial bacteria (Azospirillum brasilense, Azotobacter chroococcum, Bacillus megaterium, and Pseudomonas fluorescens). The highest yield was recorded in both inoculation treatments, whereas the highest number of buds per plant and fresh weight of globe artichoke were recorded in plants inoculated with AMF and AMF+PGPR, respectively. The P concentration in artichoke head was higher by 17.4% in both inoculation treatments compared to the control. When averaged over the microbial inoculants, higher lipophilic antioxidant activity and total phenolic content were observed in the internal than in the external bracts. The highest nitrate concentration was recorded in plants treated with AMF (774 mg kg-1). Both microbial inoculants did not affect the hydrophilic antioxidant activity (0.63 mmol ascorbic ac. eq. 100 g-1 f.w.) and total phenolic content (626.2 mg gallic acid eq. 100 g-1 d.w.). Overall, inoculation of AMF or dual inoculation AMF and PGPR could be considered an effective and sustainable tool to improve yield components with less pronounced positive effects on quality of artichoke.",,"[""Antioxidant activity"",""Cynara cardunculus l. subsp. scolymus (l.) hegi"",""Mycorrhizal symbiosis"",""Nitrate content"",""Phenolic content""]",10.17660/ActaHortic.2016.1147.6,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007508427,,0

Fish and Fisheries Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Nearly 40% of seafood is traded internationally and an even bigger proportion is affected by international trade, yet scholarship on marine fisheries has focused on global trends in stocks and catches, or on dynamics of individual fisheries, with limited attention to the link between individual fisheries, global trade and distant consumers. This paper examines the usefulness of fish price as a feedback signal to consumers about the state of fisheries and marine ecosystems. We suggest that the current nature of fisheries systems and global markets prevent transmission of such price signals from source fisheries to consumers. We propose several mechanisms that combine to weaken price signals, and present one example – the North Sea cod – to show how these mechanisms can be tested. The lack of a reliable price feedback to consumers represents a challenge for sustainable fisheries governance. We therefore propose three complimentary approaches to address the missing feedback: (i) strengthening information flow through improved traceability and visibility of individual fishers to consumers, (ii) capitalizing on the changing seafood trade structures and (iii) bypassing and complementing market mechanisms by directly targeting citizens and political actors regarding marine environmental issues through publicity and information campaigns. These strategies each have limitations and thus need to be pursued together to address the challenge of sustainability in global marine fisheries.",,"[""Cross-scale links"",""feedback"",""governance"",""marine ecosystem"",""signal"",""trade""]",10.1111/faf.12109,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84923172277,https://doi.org/10.1111/faf.12109,0

National greenhouse gas emissions accounting typically estimates N2O emissions at the country scale by aggregating all crops, under the assumption that N2O emissions are linearly related to N application. However, field studies and meta-analyses indicate a nonlinear relationship, in which N2O emissions are relatively greater at higher N application rates. Here, we apply a super-linear emissions response model to crop-specific, spatially explicit synthetic N fertilizer and manure N inputs to provide subnational accounting of global N2O emissions from croplands. We estimate 0.66 Tg of N2O-N direct global emissions circa 2000, with 50% of emissions concentrated in 13% of harvested area. Compared to estimates from the IPCC Tier 1 linear model, our updated N2O emissions range from 20% to 40% lower throughout sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe, to >120% greater in some Western European countries. At low N application rates, the weak nonlinear response of N2O emissions suggests that relatively large increases in N fertilizer application would generate relatively small increases in N2O emissions. As aggregated fertilizer data generate underestimation bias in nonlinear models, high-resolution N application data are critical to support accurate N2O emissions estimates.","[""Africa South of the Sahara"",""Climate"",""Crops, Agricultural"",""Europe, Eastern"",""Fertilizers"",""Nitrogen Dioxide"",""Nitrous Oxide""]","[""climate change"",""emissions"",""flooded rice"",""greenhouse gas"",""manure"",""meta-analysis"",""N2O"",""nitrogen"",""nitrous oxide"",""sustainable agriculture""]",10.1111/gcb.13341,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027925317,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/13215/1/Spatially%20explicit%20estimates%20of%20N2O%20emissions%20from%20croplands%20suggest%20climate%20mitigation%20opportunities%20from%20improved%20fertilizer%20management.pdf,0

Background: Limited research has been conducted concerning nurses’ work stress in developing countries, such as Nigeria. Accordingly, it is not clear whether work interventions for improving nurses’ well-being in these countries can be based on work stress models that are developed in Western countries, such as the job demand control support model, as well as on empirical findings of job demand control support research. Method: Nurses from Nurses Across the Borders Nigeria were invited to complete an online questionnaire containing validated scales; 210 questionnaires were fully completed and analysed. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the hypotheses. Results: Emotional exhaustion was higher for nurses who experienced high demands and low supervisor support. Active learning occurred when nurses worked under conditions of high control and high supervisor support. Conclusion: The findings suggest that the job demand control support model is applicable in a Nigerian nursing situation; the model indicates which occupational stressors contribute to poor well-being in Nigerian nurses and which work characteristics may boost nurses’ active learning.

These waters, from the Snæfellsnes Peninsula, within the South Iceland Seismic Zone and on the margin of the Torfajökull central volcano, are chemically and isotopically distinct from surface waters, groundwaters and low and high-temperature geothermal fluids in Iceland. Our conceptual model for the evolution of thermal and non-thermal CO2-rich waters (~ 4–80 mmol/kg ΣCO2 (aq); 6.6–192 °C) suggests that lower subsurface temperatures during retrograde alteration and cooling of a geothermal system increase the aqueous solubility of CO2, which allows anomalously high aqueous CO2 concentrations. The elevated CO2 concentrations result in slightly acidic pH (average in situ pH of 6.40), which leads to increased dissolution of primary and hydrothermal silicate minerals. Equilibrium with respect to carbonate minerals, calculated using measured solute concentrations, suggests that carbonate mineral reactions control the water compositions in these systems more than in high-temperature systems, and that hydrothermally altered basalts are sufficiently reactive to promote carbonate mineralization during geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS). Water-rock interaction with previously hydrothermally altered basalts releases trace elements to the aqueous phase to levels above the World Health Organization drinking water limit. The elements of environmental concern include arsenic (< 0.01 to 1.08 μmol/kg) and manganese (< 0.1 to 184 μmol/kg), highlighting the need for careful site selection during GCS to prevent groundwater contamination.","[""Carbon sequestration"",""Environmental concerns"",""Groundwater contamination"",""High-temperature systems"",""Natural analogue"",""Stable isotopes"",""Water rock interactions"",""World Health Organization""]","[""Basalt"",""Carbon dioxide"",""Geological carbon sequestration"",""Natural analogue"",""Stable isotopes"",""Trace elements"",""Water-rock interaction""]",10.1016/j.chemgeo.2016.09.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994633320,http://manuscript.elsevier.com/S0009254116304582/pdf/S0009254116304582.pdf,0

Although various methods, such as economic model predictive control (EMPC), are available to achieve this goal, they require that the process model be available and relatively accurate and that there be no process changes. Recently, the focus has shifted to using economic key performance indices (KPIs) to design supervisory controllers to regulate the process. In order to accomplish this, accurate models of the highly nonlinear KPIs are needed. A solution to this problem is to develop a two-step control strategy consisting of a static, offline component and a dynamic, online component. This paper proposes the use of a linear, BILIMOD method combined with a self-partitioning algorithm for the static component and gradient-based optimization method for the dynamic component. In order to deal with process changes, the static model parameters are updated. The proposed new controller strategy is tested on the wastewater treatment process. It is shown that the proposed method can quickly and effectively achieve the desired optimal point with minimal disturbance to the overall process.","[""Advanced control strategy"",""Economic optimization"",""Gradient-based optimization method"",""On-line parameter estimations"",""Partitioning algorithms"",""Set-point optimization"",""Supervisory controllers"",""Wastewater treatment process""]","[""Economic optimization"",""nonlinear system identification"",""online parameter estimation"",""setpoint optimization""]",10.1109/TIE.2015.2504557,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963819679,,0

Insights from the EU and USA,"© 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.The global strategy to reduce the harmful use of alcohol launched in 2010 by the World Health Organization includes, amongst several areas of recommended actions, providing consumer information about, and labelling, alcoholic beverages to indicate alcohol-related harm. Labelling requirements worldwide for alcoholic drinks are currently quite diverse and somewhat limited compared to labelling on food products and on tobacco. In this context, the current paper contributes to the academic and political debate on the inclusion of nutritional and health information on wine labelling, providing some insights into consumer interest in, and preferences for, such information in four core wine-producing and -consuming countries: Italy, France, Spain, and the United States of America. A rating-based conjoint analysis was performed in order to ascertain consumer preferences for different formats of additional information on wine labels, and a segmentation of the sample was performed to determine the existence of homogeneous groups of consumers in relation to the degrees of usefulness attached to the nutritional and health information on wine labels. Our results highlight the interest expressed by European and United States consumers for introducing nutrition and health information on wine labels. However, the results of conjoint analysis show some significant differences among stated preferences of the information delivery modes in different countries. In addition, segmentation analysis reveal the existence of significant differences between consumer groups with respect to their interest in receiving additional information on wine labels. These differences are not only linked to the geographic origin of the consumers, or to socio-demographic variables, but are also related to wine consumption habits, attitudes towards nutritional information, and the degree of involvement with wine. This heterogeneity of consumer preferences indicates a need for a careful consideration of wine labelling regulations and merits further investigation in order to identify labelling guidelines in terms of the message content and presentation method to be used.","[""Adult"",""Alcohol Drinking"",""Alcohol-Related Disorders"",""Consumer Behavior"",""Consumer Product Safety"",""Cross-Sectional Studies"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Guidelines as Topic"",""Health Behavior"",""Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Nutrition Policy"",""Nutritive Value"",""Product Labeling"",""Risk Assessment"",""Risk Factors"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""United States"",""Wine""]","[""Conjoint analysis"",""Consumer segmentation"",""Cross-country analysis"",""Health warnings"",""Nutritional labelling"",""Wine""]",10.3390/nu8070416,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978524003,https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/8/7/416/pdf,0

A case evaluation of stakeholder engagement was carried out to assess its effect in terms of consensus-building. The case consisted in two health impact scoping workshops engaging 20 stakeholders: policy-makers, experts and residents. A Participatory Action Research approach was adopted. Methods included observation, semi-structured questionnaires and interviews. Analysis methods consisted of several coding rounds, in-depth reading and discussion of Atlas.ti output reports, as well as studying questionnaire results. Participants reported a broadening of perspectives on health in relation to the environment and attainment of shared perspectives. Still, meaningful differences remained, indicating that joint learning experiences, trust and mutual respect created a ‘sense of consensus’ rather than a joint view on the issues at stake.

Journal of Applied Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society.As biodiversity hotspots are often characterized by high human population densities, implementation of conservation management practices that focus only on the protection and enlargement of pristine habitats is potentially unrealistic. An alternative approach to curb species extinction risk involves improving connectivity among existing habitat patches. However, evaluation of spatially explicit management strategies is challenging, as predictive models must account for the process of dispersal, which is difficult in terms of both empirical data collection and modelling. Here, we use a novel, individual-based modelling platform that couples demographic and mechanistic dispersal models to evaluate the effectiveness of realistic management scenarios tailored to conserve forest birds in a highly fragmented biodiversity hotspot. Scenario performance is evaluated based on the spatial population dynamics of a well-studied forest bird species. The largest population increase was predicted to occur under scenarios increasing habitat area. However, the effectiveness was sensitive to spatial planning. Compared to adding one large patch to the habitat network, adding several small patches yielded mixed benefits: although overall population sizes increased, specific newly created patches acted as dispersal sinks, which compromised population persistence in some existing patches. Increasing matrix connectivity by the creation of stepping stones is likely to result in enhanced dispersal success and occupancy of smaller patches. Synthesis and applications. We show that the effectiveness of spatial management is strongly driven by patterns of individual dispersal across landscapes. For species conservation planning, we advocate the use of models that incorporate adequate realism in demography and, particularly, in dispersal behaviours.",,"[""connectivity"",""conservation planning"",""demography"",""dispersal"",""Eastern Arc Mountains"",""fragmentation"",""habitat network"",""Phyllastrephus cabanisi"",""RangeShifter"",""SEPM""]",10.1111/1365-2664.12643,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962768712,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1365-2664.12643,0

A nationwide study in France,"© Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017. All rights reserved.Background Exposure to atmospheric pollutants is a danger for the health of pregnant mother and children. Our objective was to identify individual (socioeconomic and behavioural) and contextual factors associated with atmospheric pollution pregnancy exposure at the nationwide level. Method Among 14 921 women from the French nationwide ELFE (French Longitudinal Study of Children) mother-child cohort recruited in 2011, outdoor exposure levels of PM2.5, PM10 (particulate matter <2.5 μm and <10 μm in diameter) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) were estimated at the pregnancy home address from a dispersion model with 1 km resolution. We used classification and regression trees (CART) and linear regression to characterise the association of atmospheric pollutants with individual (maternal age, body mass index, parity, education level, relationship status, smoking status) and contextual (European Deprivation Index, urbanisation level) factors. Results Patterns of associations were globally similar across pollutants. For the CART approach, the highest tertile of exposure included mainly women not in a relationship living in urban and socially deprived areas, with lower education level. Linear regression models identified different determinants of atmospheric pollutants exposure according to the residential urbanisation level. In urban areas, atmospheric pollutants exposure increased with social deprivation, while in rural areas a U-shaped relationship was observed. Conclusion We highlighted social inequalities in atmospheric pollutants exposure according to contextual characteristics such as urbanisation level and social deprivation and also according to individual characteristics such as education, being in a relationship and smoking status. In French urban areas, pregnant women from the most deprived neighbourhoods were those most exposed to health-threatening atmospheric pollutants.","[""Adult"",""Air Pollutants"",""Child"",""Cohort Studies"",""Environmental Exposure"",""Environmental Pollution"",""Female"",""France"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Maternal Exposure"",""Nitrogen Dioxide"",""Particulate Matter"",""Pregnancy"",""Pregnant Women"",""Residence Characteristics"",""Rural Population"",""Socioeconomic Factors"",""Urban Population"",""Urbanization"",""Vehicle Emissions""]",,10.1136/jech-2016-208674,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032580196,,0

We study the welfare effects of residential parking subsidies through changes in car ownership for Amsterdam. We employ a boundary-discontinuity design that exploits spatial variation in the length of waiting lists for permits and therefore in the size of the parking subsidy. In the city center, the waiting time for a permit is up to four years. Our results indicate that one additional year of waiting for a parking permit reduces car ownership with 2 percentage points corresponding to a price elasticity of car demand of −0.8. We demonstrate that subsidizing residential parking induces a substantial welfare loss. On average, a parking permit induces an annual deadweight loss of €270. Furthermore, we show that the provision of parking permits is an income-regressive policy: rich households are five times more likely than poor households to receive these (implicit) parking subsidies.",,"[""Car ownership"",""Household location choice"",""Parking policy""]",10.1016/j.ecotra.2016.07.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979900877,http://papers.tinbergen.nl/15116.pdf,0

The idea of a legal right to conscientious refusal is distinguished from ideas regarding moral rights or reasons related to conscientious refusal, and none of the latter are found to support the notion of a legal right. Reasons for allowing some sort of room for conscientious refusal for healthcare professionals based on the importance of cultural identity and the fostering of a critical atmosphere might provide some support, if no countervailing factors apply. One such factor is that a legal right to healthcare professionals' conscientious refusal must comply with basic legal ethical tenets regarding the rule of law and equal treatment, and this requirement is found to create serious problems for those wishing to defend the idea under consideration. We conclude that the notion of a legal right to conscientious refusal for any profession is either fundamentally incompatible with elementary legal ethical requirements, or implausible because it undermines the functioning of a related professional sector (healthcare) or even of society as a whole.","[""Abortion, Legal"",""Conscience"",""Ethics, Medical"",""Female"",""Human Rights"",""Humans"",""Morals"",""Pregnancy"",""Refusal to Treat""]","[""conscience"",""conscientious objection"",""equal treatment"",""healthcare"",""labor law""]",10.1017/S0963180116000645,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006006283,,0

We show that optimal outcomes in terms of reduction and formalisation of informal jobs across the three countries examined are achieved with the combination of lower payroll taxes for permanent contracts and higher inspection rate for firms operating in the informal sector.

There is, however, limited information on these compounds in the African environment and insufficient information on the analytical approaches used to obtain data. This paper presents a review on BFR levels in the African environment and the various analytical methodologies specifically applied in Africa for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polybrominated biphenyls and alternative-BFRs. The analyses include liquid sample preparation using liquid-liquid and solid phase extraction and solid sample preparation involving Soxhlet extraction, with ultrasound-assisted extraction increasingly being applied. Instrumental detection techniques were limited to gas chromatography coupled with electron capture detector and electron impact ionisation with single quadrupole mass spectrometers. Information on congener profile prevalence in indoor dust, soil, aquatic environment (water, sediment, and aquatic organisms), eggs, wastewater treatment plant compartments, landfills (leachate and sediment) and breast milk are presented. Although PBDEs were inconsistently detected, contamination was reported for all investigated matrices in the African environment. The manifestation in remote regions indicates the ubiquitous prevalence and long-range transport of these compounds. Levels in sediment, and breast milk from some African countries were higher than reported for Asia and Europe. Due to limited data or non-detection of alternative-BFRs, it is unclear whether banned formulations were replaced in Africa. Most of the data reported for BFR levels in Africa were obtained in non-African laboratories or in South Africa and formed the basis for our discussion of reported contamination levels and related methodologies.","[""Africa"",""Brominated flame retardants"",""Environmental levels"",""Instrumental analysis"",""Sample preparation"",""Africa"",""Animals"",""Chromatography, Gas"",""Dust"",""Environment"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Environmental Pollutants"",""Fishes"",""Flame Retardants"",""Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers"",""Halogenation"",""Hydrocarbons, Brominated"",""Polybrominated Biphenyls"",""Quality Control"",""Waste Water"",""Water Purification""]","[""Africa"",""Brominated flame retardants"",""Environmental levels"",""Instrumental analysis"",""Sample preparation""]",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.08.097,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984704765,,0

Cryptosporidiosis is a severe diarrheal disease in malnourished children and immunocompromised individuals, with the only FDA-approved drug treatment currently being nitazoxanide. The existing therapies for toxoplasmosis, an important pathology in immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women, also have serious limitations. With the aim of developing alternative therapeutic options to address these health problems, we tested a number of benzoxaboroles, boron-containing compounds shown to be active against various infectious agents, for inhibition of the growth of Cryptosporidium parasites in mammalian cells. A 3-aminomethyl benzoxaborole, AN6426, with activity in the micromolar range and with activity comparable to that of nitazoxanide, was identified and further characterized using biophysical measurements of affinity and crystal structures of complexes with the editing domain of Cryptosporidium leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS). The same compound was shown to be active against Toxoplasma parasites, with the activity being enhanced in the presence of norvaline, an amino acid that can be mischarged by LeuRS. Our observations are consistent with AN6426 inhibiting protein synthesis in both Cryptosporidium and Toxoplasma by forming a covalent adduct with tRNALeu in the LeuRS editing active site and suggest that further exploitation of the benzoxaborole scaffold is a valid strategy to develop novel, much needed antiparasitic agents.","[""Animals"",""Antiprotozoal Agents"",""Boron Compounds"",""Cryptosporidium parvum"",""Crystallography, X-Ray"",""Dogs"",""Drug Evaluation, Preclinical"",""Enzyme Inhibitors"",""Fibroblasts"",""Humans"",""Leucine-tRNA Ligase"",""Madin Darby Canine Kidney Cells"",""Molecular Docking Simulation"",""Protein Conformation"",""Toxoplasma""]",,10.1128/AAC.00873-16,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992731507,https://aac.asm.org/content/aac/60/10/5817.full.pdf,0

Thus, the effective energy design and/or retrofit of these buildings can yield huge energy, environmental and economic benefits. In this frame, the study investigates the energy retrofit of a hospital building, i.e., the “D” Pavilion of the “A. Cardarelli” hospital facility in Naples (South Italy). The building is modeled in EnergyPlus and the energy model is calibrated by comparison against measured data, provided by an annual experimental campaign. Hence, in order to address building energy retrofit, a rigorous cost-optimal analysis is conducted by coupling EnergyPlus and MATLAB®. The investigated energy retrofit measures (ERMs) are addressed to the energy systems and to the exploitation of renewable energy sources. ERMs for the building envelope are excluded because they are not effective for the considered case study. The optimization allows to explore a comprehensive domain of retrofit scenarios, and thus, finally, robust cost-optimal solutions are found in correspondence of different discount rates. These solutions yield substantial reductions of primary energy consumption, global cost and polluting emissions with payback periods around 4 years.","[""Building energy model"",""Building performance"",""Energy calibration"",""Energy retrofit"",""Hospital buildings"",""Optimal analysis""]","[""Building energy modeling"",""Building performance optimization"",""Cost-optimal analysis"",""Energy calibration"",""Energy retrofit"",""Hospital buildings""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048619177,,0

However, this phenomenon was not observed in this species under temperate (TEM) conditions, which could lead to differences in the ability to assimilate CO2 between the sites. We hypothesise that the overall importance of such a reduction in gs,max on photosynthesis is modulated by other factors affecting carbon gain, mainly mesophyll conductance to CO2 (gm), through a plastic response to changes in environmental conditions (i.e., vapour pressure deficit, VPD, and mean daily quantum flux density, Qint). The results reveal that leaves grown at the TEM site did not show an increased ability for net CO2 assimilation (AN), mainly due to an equal gm at both sites. This fact is explained by a trade-off between an increased conductance of the gas phase (gias) and a reduced conductance of the liquid phase (gliq) at the TEM site compared with the MED site. In spite of the reduction in gs,max at the MED site, transpiration (E) did not diminish during midsummer to the levels of the TEM site due to a higher VPD found at the MED site, yielding a higher water use efficiency (AN/E) at the TEM site. Moreover, photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency was also higher at the TEM site, indicating these leaves can reach similar values of AN with lower nitrogen investment that those at the MED site. These results suggest that Q. coccifera does not always use the main resources (water and nutrients) at leaf level as efficiently as possible. Moreover, the different patterns of resource use (in particular N), together with the functional plasticity, cannot overcome the morpho-functional constraints that limit photosynthetic activity, even under potentially favourable conditions.","[""Carbon"",""Carbon Dioxide"",""Circadian Rhythm"",""Light"",""Mediterranean Region"",""Mesophyll Cells"",""Nitrogen"",""Photosynthesis"",""Pigments, Biological"",""Plant Leaves"",""Plant Stomata"",""Quercus"",""Time Factors"",""Vapor Pressure"",""Water""]","[""epicuticular waxes"",""Mediterranean climate"",""mesophyll conductance"",""photosynthesis"",""PNUE"",""stomatal conductance"",""WUE""]",10.1093/treephys/tpv129,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964330381,https://academic.oup.com/treephys/article-pdf/36/3/356/17433385/tpv129.pdf,0

We aimed to examine the association between living situation and long-term mortality in patients with ischemic stroke and a control group, and to explore whether this association is modified by patient gender. Methods: This is a prospective case-control study of 600 patients with ischemic stroke before 70 years of age and 600 age-and sex-matched controls who have been included in the Sahlgrenska Study on Ischemic Stroke. Mortality data were collected through national registers and medical records. We used Cox regression models for identifying predictors of mortality. Results: In the entire sample, mean age was 57 years, proportion of males 64 %, proportion living alone 28 %, and median follow-up 8.6 years. Mortality rates were 36 % among patients living alone, 17 % among cohabitant patients, 15 % among controls living alone, and 9 % among cohabitant controls. Living alone was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in cases after adjustment for stroke severity, stroke subtype, and vascular risk factors including physical activity, alcohol consumption, and socioeconomic status. A significant interaction was found between gender and living situation; the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 3.47 (95 % Confidence Interval 2.13-5.65) in male patients living alone, whereas no significant association was observed in women. Living alone was also a predictor of vascular mortality among cases and of all-cause mortality among controls.

Atkinson, and J. D. M. Gordon.This review examines interregional linkages and gives an overview perspective on marine ecosystem functioning in the north-eastern Atlantic. It is based on three of the 'systems' considered by the European Network of Excellence for Ocean Ecosystems Analysis (EUR-OCEANS was established in 2004 under the European Framework VI funding programme to promote integration of marine ecological research within Europe), the Arctic and Nordic Seas, North Atlantic shelf seas and North Atlantic. The three systems share common open boundaries and the transport of water, heat, nutrients and particulates across these boundaries modifies local processes. Consistent with the EUR-OCEANS concept of 'end-to-end' analyses of marine food webs, the review takes an integrated approach linking ocean physics, lower trophic levels and working up the food web to top predators such as marine mammals. We begin with an overview of the regions focusing on the major physical patterns and their implications for the microbial community, phytoplankton, zooplankton, fish and top predators. Human-induced links between the regional systems are then considered and finally possible changes in the regional linkages over the next century are discussed. Because of the scale of potential impacts of climate change, this issue is considered in a separate section. The review demonstrates that the functioning of the ecosystems in each of the regions cannot be considered in isolation and the role of the atmosphere and ocean currents in linking the North Atlantic Ocean, North Atlantic shelf seas and the Arctic and Nordic Seas must be taken into account.

The most prominent representatives of these so-called extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanosized exosomes (70-150 nm), which are derivatives of the endosomal system, and microvesicles (100-1000 nm), which are produced by outward budding of the plasma membrane. Nanosized EVs are released by almost all cell types and mediate targeted intercellular communication under physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Containing cell-type-specific signatures, EVs have been proposed as biomarkers in a variety of diseases. Furthermore, according to their physical functions, EVs of selected cell types have been used as therapeutic agents in immune therapy, vaccination trials, regenerative medicine, and drug delivery. Undoubtedly, the rapidly emerging field of basic and applied EV research will significantly influence the biomedicinal landscape in the future. In this Perspective, we, a network of European scientists from clinical, academic, and industry settings collaborating through the H2020 European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) program European Network on Microvesicles and Exosomes in Health and Disease (ME-HAD), demonstrate the high potential of nanosized EVs for both diagnostic and therapeutic (i.e., theranostic) areas of nanomedicine.","[""Intercellular communications"",""Membrane microdomains"",""Pathophysiological"",""Phospholipid membrane"",""Physical function"",""Recent researches"",""Science and Technology"",""Therapeutic agents"",""Animals"",""Cell Communication"",""Cell-Derived Microparticles"",""Clinical Trials as Topic"",""Drug Delivery Systems"",""Exosomes"",""Extracellular Vesicles"",""Humans"",""Nanomedicine"",""Theranostic Nanomedicine""]",,10.1021/acsnano.5b08015,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968866526,http://repository.bilkent.edu.tr/bitstream/11693/38156/1/Evidence-Based%20Clinical%20Use%20of%20Nanoscale%20Extracellular%20Vesicles%20in%20Nanomedicine.pdf,0

Our study therefore aimed to assess: (1) mortality in AS versus the general population, and (2) predictors of death in the AS population. Methods Nationwide cohorts of patients with AS diagnosed at rheumatology or internal medicine outpatient clinics (n=8600) and age-matched, sex-matched and county-matched general population comparators (n=40â €..460) were identified from the National Patient Register and the census register, respectively. The follow-up period began on 1 January 2006 or at the first date of registered diagnosis thereafter and extended until death, emigration or 31 December 2012, whichever occurred first. Socioeconomic variables, AS-related clinical manifestations, joint surgery, comorbidities and medication were identified from other national registers. Cox regression models were used to determine mortality and predictors for death in the AS cohort. Results There were 496 deaths in the AS cohort and 1533 deaths in the control cohort resulting in an age-Adjusted and sex-Adjusted HR of 1.60 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.77), with increased mortality for men (age-Adjusted HR=1.53, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.72) and women (age-Adjusted HR=1.83, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.22). Within the AS cohort, statistically significant predictors for death were a lower level of education, general comorbidities (diabetes, infections, cardiovascular, pulmonary and malignant diseases) and previous hip replacement surgery.

Urban agriculture is common and of economic value for low income families. In Arusha, many households sell eggs from free-ranging backyard chicken. In 2011, 159 eggs from different households in five different locations in Arusha were collected, homogenized, pooled into 28 composite samples and analyzed for a wide selection of POPs. Levels of POPs varied widely within and between the locations. The levels of dieldrin and σDDT ranged between 2 and 98,791 and 2 and 324 ng/g lipid weight (lw), respectively. EU MRLs of 0.02 mg/kg dieldrin for eggs were exceeded in 4/28 samples. PCBs, HCHs, chlordanes, toxaphenes and endosulfanes were found at lower frequency and levels. Brominated flame retardants (BFRs), e.g polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromphenoxy)ethane (BTBPE) were present in 100%, 60% and 46% of the composite samples, respectively. Octa-and deca-BDEs were the dominating PBDEs and BDE 209 levels ranged between <. LOQ (limit of quantification) - 312 ng/g lw. Dioxins were measured using the DR-LUC bio-assay and found in levels of <. LOQ - 20 pg bio-TEQs/g lw. Four samples (13%) exceeded the maximum level of 5 pg/g total WHO-TEQs for hen eggs set by the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1259/2011. The daily/weekly intake was calculated and risk was characterized for all compounds comparing with available toxicity reference values (TRVs) such as the provisional tolerable intake (PTDI) or Reference Doses (RfDs). In one sample dieldrin exceeded the PTDI (100 ng/kg bw/day). Correlation was found between bio-TEQs and lipid adjusted levels of σPBDEs, suggesting similar sources.

In particular, memory corruption attacks play a predominant role as they allow remote compromise of IoT devices. Control-flow integrity (CFI) is a promising and generic defense technique against these attacks. However, given the nature of IoT deployments, existing protection mechanisms for traditional computing environments (including CFI) need to be adapted to the IoT setting. In this paper, we describe the challenges of enabling CFI on microcontroller (MCU) based IoT devices. We then present CaRE, the first interrupt-aware CFI scheme for low-end MCUs. CaRE uses a novel way of protecting the CFI metadata by leveraging TrustZone-M security extensions introduced in the ARMv8-M architecture. Its binary instrumentation approach preserves the memory layout of the target MCU software, allowing pre-built bare-metal binary code to be protected by CaRE.

In addition to GBV's physical and social consequences, the psychological effects can be pervasive. Access to evidence-based psychological interventions that seek to support the mental health of women affected by such adversity is rare in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: The current study evaluates a brief evidence-informed psychological intervention developed by the World Health Organization for adults impacted by adversity (Problem Management Plus; PM+). A feasibility randomised control trial (RCT) was conducted to inform a fully powered trial. Community health workers delivered the intervention to 70 women residing in three peri-urban settings in Nairobi, Kenya. Women, among whom 80% were survivors of GBV (N = 56), were randomised to receive five sessions of either PM+ (n = 35) by community health workers or enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU; n = 35). Results: PM+ was not associated with any adverse events. Although the study was not powered to identify effects and accordingly did not identify effects on the primary outcome measure of general psychological distress, women survivors of adversity, including GBV, who received PM+ displayed greater reductions in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms following treatment than those receiving ETAU. Conclusions: This feasibility study suggests that PM+ delivered by lay health workers is an acceptable and safe intervention to reach women experiencing common mental disorders and be inclusive for those affected by GBV and can be studied in a RCT in this setting. The study sets the stage for a fully powered, definitive controlled trial to assess this potentially effective intervention.

A better understanding of the link between climate and energy demand responses is crucial to improve energy forecasting outcomes and to evaluate the potential of climate change adaptation strategies.

We classify the models used in papers published in peer-reviewed journals and observe that the credibility of energy demand projections hinges in part on the assumption that the shape and type of the temperature response function is stationary. The evidence of acclimatization to warmer conditions may oppose this assumption. While the studies reviewed here only tested the impact of changes in the temperature thresholds and the shape of temperature response functions, a comprehensive understanding of changes in energy demand patterns and climate adaptation potentials requires knowledge of building stock turnover rates and associated changes in technology and behavioral responses of building occupants.

However, an appropriate measure of dispersal capacity for benthic invertebrates is still lacking. The dispersal of benthic invertebrates occurs mainly during the aquatic (larval) and aerial (adult) life stages, and the dispersal of each stage can be further subdivided into active and passive modes. Based on these four possible dispersal modes, we first developed a metric (which is very similar to the well-known and widely used saprobic index) to estimate the dispersal capacity for 802 benthic invertebrate taxa by incorporating a weight for each mode. Second, we tested this metric using benthic invertebrate community data from a) 23 large restored river sites with substantial improvements of river bottom habitats dating back 1 to 10 years, b) 23 unrestored sites very close to the restored sites, and c) 298 adjacent surrounding sites (mean ± standard deviation: 13.0 ± 9.5 per site) within a distance of up to 5 km for each restored site in the low mountain and lowland areas of Germany. We hypothesize that our metric will reflect the temporal succession process of benthic invertebrate communities colonizing the restored sites, whereas no temporal changes are expected in the unrestored and surrounding sites. By applying our metric to these three river treatment categories, we found that the average dispersal capacity of benthic invertebrate communities in the restored sites significantly decreased in the early years following restoration, whereas there were no changes in either the unrestored or the surrounding sites. After all taxa had been divided into quartiles representing weak to strong dispersers, this pattern became even more obvious; strong dispersers colonized the restored sites during the first year after restoration and then significantly decreased over time, whereas weak dispersers continued to increase. The successful application of our metric to river restoration might be promising in further applications of this metric, for example, in analyzing metacommunity structure or community's recovery from extreme events such as floods, droughts or catastrophic pollution episodes.","[""Community succession"",""Integrated dispersal metric"",""Macroinvertebrates"",""River restoration"",""Weight approach"",""Animal Distribution"",""Animals"",""Biodiversity"",""Environmental Restoration and Remediation"",""Germany"",""Invertebrates"",""Rivers""]","[""Community succession"",""Integrated dispersal metric"",""Macroinvertebrate"",""River restoration"",""Weight approach""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.06.251,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978879603,,0

Vietnam's challenge for the upcoming period is to ensure energy resources for economic development, associated with sustainable development, environmental protection and to combat climate change. Therefore, selection and use of appropriate and effective energy is one of the important factors. In addition, the development of clean energy sources is essential in the future. In the present context, the developments of renewable energy sources and nuclear energy have various restrictions, while traditional energy such as coal and oil is being exhausted. Consequently, unconventional gas development can be a good solution for Vietnam in the future. In addition, the replacement of traditional energy sources such as coal and oil products plays a role in the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially in the power sector.

The model is designed for urban planners, practitioners and researchers who demand meteorological information for urban planning and research applications. The model is based on the concept of nocturnal cooling, progressing in two distinct phases, i.e. site-dependent cooling around sunset and site-independent cooling from about 1 or 2 h after sunset until sunrise. Cooling rates are usually determined predominantly by prevailing weather conditions (i.e. clearness of the sky and wind speed), followed by maximum daily air temperature and by sky view factors. Second phase cooling is chiefly determined by sky clearness and wind speed. The findings and statistical results from the analysis of observational data during warm months (May–September) from Gothenburg, Sweden, as well as from past studies, were used. The model requires standard meteorological variables (i.e. wind speed, incoming short-wave radiation, air temperature, relative air humidity, air pressure) at a reference station as well as geometrical information (i.e. the sky view factor of the site and the geographical co-ordinates of the reference meteorological station). The model simulates the characteristic development of cooling rates in the two phases at open sites and built-up sites with different sky view factors under a wide range of weather conditions in warm months. Using the modelled cooling rates, nocturnal air temperature is estimated easily with the accuracy of root mean square error (RMSE) ≤1.54 °C and R2 ≥0.78.","[""Empirical modelling"",""Nocturnal cooling"",""Planning applications"",""Two phase"",""Urban heat island""]","[""empirical modelling"",""intra-urban heat island"",""nocturnal cooling rate"",""two-phase cooling"",""urban planning applications""]",10.1002/met.1558,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964318762,https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/met.1558,0

However, all energy value chains use natural capital (NC) other than the atmosphere and impact ecosystem services (ES) other than climate regulation in different ways. In this chapter the consumption of all natural capital categories by various energy systems is discussed along with their impact on the ecosystem services provision. Metrics that can be used to quantify the positive and negative contribution of energy systems to each ecosystem service are investigated, and methods of comparing the overall impact of each energy system are proposed. These impacts and comparison metrics are discussed using the example of coal- and biomass-fired thermal electricity generation. Coal is very detrimental to ES unless the GHG can be stored by carbon capture and storage (CCS) and clean coal technology is used. Biomass firing, on the other hand, can have a positive impact on ES as long as the feedstock is grown on land that does not compete with other land use vital to ES. However, the total contribution that bioenergy can make to a low-carbon economy is constrained by the land available.","[""Biomass productions"",""Coal mining"",""Economic costs"",""Ecosystem services"",""Energy provision"",""Energy sector"",""Land-use change"",""Natural capital"",""Power station"",""Value chains""]","[""Bioenergy value chain"",""Biomass production"",""Coal mining"",""Coal-fueled power stations"",""Economic cost-benefit analysis"",""Ecosystem services"",""Energy provision"",""Energy sector"",""Land-use change"",""Natural capital""]",10.1002/9781119297376.ch6,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050235963,,0

This article addresses the fundaments for involving scientists from these fields of science in IPBES, and reflects on the existing barriers. It builds on previous research on IPBES from various perspectives, as well as on the author's insights from work in the organization. A fundamental condition recognized is that there needs to be a qualified understanding of what it means to integrate natural sciences and social sciences/humanities, and also that the latter have to be accepted on their own terms. Other barriers are related to the contextualisation of biodiversity issues and the more politically sensitive character of research carried out in social sciences and humanities.

All rights reserved.Marine environmental legislation is increasingly expressing a need to consider the quality of pelagic habitats. This paper uses the European Union marine strategy framework to explore the concept of good environmental status (GES) of pelagic habitat with the aim to build a wider understanding of the issue. Pelagic ecosystems have static, persistent and ephemeral features, with manageable human activities primarily impacting the persistent features. The paper explores defining the meaning of ""good"", setting boundaries to assess pelagic habitat and the challenges of considering habitat biodiversity in a moving medium. It concludes that for pelagic habitats to be in GES and able to provide goods and services to humans, three conditions should be met: (i) all species present under current environmental conditions should be able to find the pelagic habitats essential to close their life cycles; (ii) biogeochemical regulation is maintained at normal levels; (iii) critical physical dynamics and movements of biota and water masses at multiple scales are not obstructed. Reference points for acceptable levels of each condition and how these may change over time in line with prevailing oceanographic conditions, should be discussed by knowledge brokers, managers and stakeholders. Managers should think about a habitat hydrography rather than a habitat geography. Setting the bounds of the habitats requires a consideration of dimension, scale and gradients. It is likely that to deal with the challenges caused by a dynamic environment and the relevance of differing spatial and temporal scales, we will need to integrate multidisciplinary empirical data sets with spatial and temporal models to assess and monitor progress towards, or displacement from GES of the pelagic habitat.",,"[""marine strategy framework directive"",""MPA"",""pelagic habitats"",""plankton"",""seascape""]",10.1093/icesjms/fsx158,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030660002,https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/74/9/2333/29022312/fsx158.pdf,14

Matt Davies et al.The effects of fire and its use on European peatlands and heaths are the focus of considerable research and debate due to the important services these ecosystems provide and the threats they face from climatic and land-use change. Whilst in some countries ecologists are actively promoting the restoration of historic fire management regimes, in the UK the debate has become increasingly acrimonious. Positions seem entrenched between continuing the intensive form of management associated with grouse moors or ceasing burning and seeking to eliminate fire altogether. In a recent paper we argued that participants' positions appeared influenced by political and philosophical beliefs associated with, for example, private land-ownership, hunting, and associated conservation conflicts such as raptor persecution. We also suggested there was inadequate engagement with key concepts and evidence from fire and peatland ecology. We argued that management debates should aim to be inclusive and evidence-based, and to understand the benefits and costs of different fire regimes. In a strongly-worded critique of our paper, George Monbiot (author of ""Feral: Searching for Enchantment on the Frontiers of Rewilding"") suggested we: i) framed our research question too narrowly; ii) made the implicit assumption that moorlands were the ""right"" ecosystem for the UK countryside; and iii) failed to adequately engage with arguments put forward for cessation of managed burning. Here we critically examine each of these issues to provide further insight into how adaptive, participatory land-management could develop. We argue that a productive debate must acknowledge that complex trade-offs are inevitable during ecological management. Choosing the ""right"" ecosystem is difficult, especially in a landscape with a long history of human influence, and the answer depends on the values and ecosystem services we prioritize. Natural resource management decisions will be improved if based on an understanding and valuation of the multiple scales and levels of organization at which ecological diversity exists, the role of disturbance in controlling ecosystem composition and function, and the need for participatory action.",,"[""Adaptive management"",""Diversity"",""Heathland"",""Managed burning"",""Moorland"",""Participatory"",""Scale""]",10.3897/natureconservation.16.10739,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85008439815,https://natureconservation.pensoft.net/article/10739/download/pdf/,0

The algorithms in these programs are often complex and can be understood only with advanced training in mathematics and programming, topics that are beyond the capabilities of most fisheries biologists and empirical population geneticists. The backward looking Kingman coalescent model, based on the classic forward-looking Wright-Fisher model of genetic change, is used in many genetics software programs to generate null distributions against which to test hypotheses. An article in this issue by Niwa et al. shows that the assumption of bifurcations at nodes in the Kingman coalescent model is inappropriate for highly fecund Japanese sardines, which have type III life histories. Species with this life history pattern are better modelled with multiple mergers at the nodes of a coalescent gene genealogy. However, only a few software programs allow analysis with multiple-merger coalescent models. This parameter misspecification produces demographic reconstructions that reach too far into the past and greatly overestimates genetically effective population sizes (the number of individuals actually contributing to the next generation).

However, scallops with small, darkened and stringy adductor muscle (gray meat) episodically occur along the Eastern Seaboard, most recently in the rotational management areas of Georges Bank after extended fishing closures. These gray meat scallops are associated with reduced harvestable biomass and mass mortality events. We tested age, nutritional stress and disease as causative agents for this condition. Adult scallops of different shell heights (SH) ranging from (90–145 mm) were collected from Georges Bank and analyzed for meat quality and the presence of pathogens using biochemical, histopathological and molecular methods. Gray meat occurrence was weakly correlated with shell height only explaining 8.49% of the variance in a generalized additive model (GAMS). Gray meat weights were lower than white meat (p < 0.001) and there was a dramatic reduction in protein content (p < 0.05) in gray meat scallops associated with extensive myodegeneration. Amino acid profiles confirmed the breakdown of muscle tissue with an increase in free hydroxyproline in gray meat scallops. Infection by an apicomplexan parasite was detected in the muscle tissue of all gray meat scallops tested. An intermediate pathology stage (brown meat) was also identified. As the parasitic infection increased, meat quality decreased. Numerous developmental stages of the parasite were present in various organs of the scallops. This apicomplexan has an identical SSU rDNA sequence to a novel parasite occurring in the Iceland scallop during a recent mass mortality event. The range of this parasite in Atlantic sea scallops and the effect of abiotic/biotic stressors on pathogenicity are currently unknown.

Although epiphytic diatoms play an essential role in the Antarctic marine food web, basic information regarding their ecology, biodiversity and biogeography is largely unavailable. Here, we synthesise studies on Ross Sea epiphytic diatoms collected during 11 summer Antarctic expeditions between the years 1989/90 and 2011/12, presenting a full list of diatom taxa associated with three macroalgal species (Iridaea cordata, Phyllophora antarctica, and Plocamium cartilagineum) and their epiphytic sessile fauna. Diatom communities found during the three summer months at various depths and sampling stations differed significantly in terms of species composition, growth form structure and abundances. Densities ranged from 21 to >8000 cells mm-2, and were significantly higher on the surface of epiphytic micro-fauna than on any of the macroalgal species examined. Generally, host organisms characterized by higher morphological heterogeneity (sessile microfauna, ramified Plocamium) supported richer diatom communities than those with more uniform surfaces (Iridaea). Differences between epiphytic communities associated with different macroalgae were reflected better in species composition than in growth form structure. The latter changed significantly with season, which was related strongly to the changing ice conditions. A general trend towards an increasing number of erect forms in deeper waters and tube-dwelling diatoms in the shallowest sites (2-5 m) was also observed. This study explores further important and largely previously unknown aspects of relationships and interactions between Antarctic epiphytic diatoms and their micro- and macroenvironments.","[""Antarctic Regions"",""Bays"",""Diatoms"",""Ecosystem"",""Expeditions"",""Food Chain"",""Geography"",""Marine Biology"",""Microscopy, Electron, Scanning"",""Seasons"",""Seaweed""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0153254,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964407581,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0153254&type=printable,0

Cost-efficient distribution of mitigation across regions and economic sectors is typically calculated using a global uniform carbon price in climate stabilization scenarios. However, in reality such a carbon price would substantially affect food availability. Here, we assess the implications of climate change mitigation in the land use sector for agricultural production and food security using an integrated partial equilibrium modelling framework and explore ways of relaxing the competition between mitigation in agriculture and food availability. Using a scenario that limits global warming cost-efficiently across sectors to 1.5◦C, results indicate global food calorie losses ranging from 110–285 kcal per capita per day in 2050 depending on the applied demand elasticities. This could translate into a rise in undernourishment of 80–300 million people in 2050. Less ambitious greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in the land use sector reduces the associated food security impact significantly, however the 1.5◦C target would not be achieved without additional reductions outside the land use sector. Efficiency of GHG mitigation will also depend on the level of participation globally. Our results show that if non-Annex-I countries decide not to contribute to mitigation action while other parties pursue their mitigation efforts to reach the global climate target, food security impacts in these non-Annex-I countries will be higher than if they participate in a global agreement, as inefficient mitigation increases agricultural production costs and therefore food prices. Land-rich countries with a high proportion of emissions from land use change, such as Brazil, could reduce emissions with only a marginal effect on food availability. In contrast, agricultural mitigation in high population (density) countries, such as China and India, would lead to substantial food calorie loss without a major contribution to global GHG mitigation. Increasing soil carbon sequestration on agricultural land would allow reducing the implied calorie loss by 65% when sticking to the initially estimated land use mitigation requirements, thereby limiting the impact on undernourishment to 20–75 million people, and storing significant amounts of carbon in soils.","[""AFOLU"",""Climate change mitigation"",""Food security"",""Partial equilibrium model"",""Soil carbon""]","[""AFOLU"",""Climate change mitigation"",""Food security"",""Partial equilibrium model"",""Soil carbon""]",10.1088/1748-9326/aa8c83,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032735674,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/aa8c83/pdf,0

The aim of the present study was to determine the diversity and prevalence of Aeromonas spp. both in reclaimed water used for irrigation and in the three types of vegetables irrigated with that water. Seven of the 11 (63.6%) samples of reclaimed water and all samples of vegetables were positive for the presence of Aeromonas. A total of 216 Aeromonas isolates were genotyped and corresponded to 132 different strains that after identification by sequencing the rpoD gene belonged to 10 different species. The prevalence of the species varied depending on the type of sample. In the secondary treated reclaimed water A. caviae and A. media dominated (91.4%) while A. salmonicida, A. media, A. allosaccharophila and A. popoffii represented 74.0% of the strains in the irrigation water. In vegetables, A. caviae (75.0%) was the most common species, among which a strain isolated from lettuce had the same genotype (ERIC pattern) as a strain recovered from the irrigation water. Furthermore, the same genotype of the species A. sanarellii was recovered from parsley and tomatoes demonstrating that irrigation water was the source of contamination and confirming the risk for public health.","[""Aeromonas"",""Agricultural Irrigation"",""Halogenation"",""Humans"",""Spain"",""Ultraviolet Rays"",""Vegetables"",""Waste Water"",""Water Microbiology"",""Water Purification""]","[""Aeromonas"",""Irrigation water"",""Ready to eat vegetables"",""Reclaimed water""]",10.1016/j.envres.2016.12.026,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009739606,,0

An exhaustive systematic literature review and a stakeholder consultation were carried out in order to (i) collect detailed information about current knowledge on discards in EU SSF and gauge stakeholder perceptions about potential impacts of the discard ban in European SSF, (ii) examine the capacity of the SSF industry to implement the discard ban, and (iii) explore the limits and feasibility of implementing such a measure. The results of this study show that little attention has been given by the scientific community to discards in EU SSF. Indeed, the systematic literature review shows that this problem is relatively unexplored in the EU. In addition, the effectiveness of a discard ban in industrial fisheries is still unclear, mainly because discard data are not systematically collected by fisheries authorities.

Mortality associated with surgery for phaeochromocytoma has dramatically decreased over the last decades. Many factors contributed to the dramatic decline of the mortality rate, and the influence of an α-receptor blockade is unclear and has never been tested in a randomized trial. We evaluated intraoperative haemodynamic conditions and the incidence of complications in patients with and without α-receptor blockade undergoing surgery for catecholamine producing tumours. Methods. Haemodynamic conditions and perioperative complications were assessed in 110 patients with (B) and 166 without (N) α-receptor blockade. Data were analysed as a consecutive case series of 303 cases and subsequently via propensity score matching, and presented as mean and confidence interval (CI). Results. No difference in maximal intraoperative systolic arterial pressures (B = 178 mm Hg (CI 169-187) vs N = 185 mm Hg (CI 177-193; P = 0.2542) and hypertensive episodes above 250 mm Hg were found (P = 0.7474) for the closed case series. No major complications occurred. Propensity score matching (75 pairs) revealed a significant difference of 17 mm Hg in maximal intraoperative systolic bp for these selected pairs (P = 0.024). Conclusions. Only a slight difference in mean maximal systolic arterial pressure was detected between patients with or without an α-receptor blockade. There was no difference in the incidence of excessive hypertensive episodes between groups and no major complications occurred.

This conference report summarizes the findings of the session and the messages delivered by finance industry representatives. Significant investment in low carbon assets is required to maintain global temperature increases below 2 °C. The two resounding themes throughout the session were that in order to attract capital for low carbon investments fossil fuel subsidies must end and a higher carbon price is needed to incentivise investment. Furthermore, accounting and regulatory bodies need to implement more stringent disclosure and reporting requirements so that climate risk is properly understood by investors. There is significant appetite for investment in the low carbon sector which is demonstrated by the growth in the green bond market.

However, current methods to measure effects of stressors on horizontal gene transfer have limitations and often fall short, as the estimated endpoints can be a mix of both the number of transfer events and clonal growth of transconjugants. Our aim was therefore to achieve a proper strategy for assessing the minimal concentration of a stressor (exemplified by tetracycline) that drives horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance from a complex community to a model pathogen. Conditions were optimized to improve a culture-based approach using the bacterial community of treated sewage effluent as donor, and fluorescent, traceable Escherichia coli as recipient. Reduced level of background resistance, differentiation of isolates as well as decreased risk for measuring effects of selection were achieved through the use of chromogenic medium, optimization of conjugation time as well as applying a different antibiotic for isolation of transconjugants than the one tested for its ability to drive transfer. Using this assay, we showed that a very low concentration of tetracycline, 10. μg/L i.e. 150 times below the minimal inhibitory concentration of the recipient, promoted horizontal transfer of multiple antibiotic-resistance determinants. Higher concentrations favoured selection of a tetracycline-resistance phenotype along with a decline in the number of detectable transfer events. The described method can be used to evaluate different environmental conditions and factors that trigger horizontal dissemination of mobile resistance elements, eventually resulting in the formation of drug-resistant pathogens.","[""Antibiotic resistance"",""Conjugation"",""Genetic elements"",""Inhibitory concentration"",""Tetracycline"",""Anti-Bacterial Agents"",""Biological Assay"",""Drug Resistance, Microbial"",""Gene Transfer, Horizontal"",""Microbial Sensitivity Tests""]","[""Antibiotic resistance"",""Conjugation"",""Mobile genetic elements"",""Sub-inhibitory concentration"",""Tetracycline""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.01.044,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84955325504,,0

Such issues are important for individuals to enable active participation in society. This study has a particular interest in the use of carbon footprint calculators (tools for calculating carbon dioxide emissions of human activities) in the context of learning about environmental issues and climate change. More specifically, it contributes with insights into how such tools foster different modes of reasoning about the environment. The empirical data consist of video recordings of 15 Swedish upper secondary students’ classroom discussions. The study derived from one specific half-day-lesson with activities related to the use of a carbon footprint calculator. In the first part of the lesson, the students worked individually with the tool for calculating their carbon footprint, and in the second part of the lesson, the students discussed their carbon footprints in groups. The focus of the analysis is on the group discussion and on what modes of reasoning and arguing about the environment that are made possible through the students’ use of the calculator. The study investigates the students’ accounts in relation to how they discuss and compare their carbon footprints. That is, how the students in their discussions explain and justify actions in their everyday lifestyle. The findings indicate that the carbon footprint calculator supports different modes of reasoning and arguing about the environmental impact of actions in students’ everyday lifestyle. The carbon footprint calculator offers students a new arena for developing an understanding of climate change and its relationships to human activities. The results shed light on the ways in which students are able to quantify, analyse and compare carbon dioxide emissions both on an individual level but also at a systemic level (across countries) after having used the carbon footprint calculator.

Evaluation can enhance implementation of such an approach and demonstrate the extent of effectiveness. To be able to support professionals in the evaluation of ICIAs we studied barriers to and facilitators of ICIA evaluation. In this study ten professionals of two Dutch municipalities involved in the evaluation of an ICIA participated. We conducted semi-structured interviews (n = 12), observed programme meetings (n = 4) and carried out document analysis. Data were analyzed using a thematic content approach. We learned that evaluation is hampered when it is perceived as unfeasible due to limited time and budget, a lack of evaluation knowledge or a negative evaluation attitude.

Various strategies and combinations of policy mechanisms have been adopted by different countries to change farmer behaviours with varying degrees of success. This paper focuses on the use of advice delivery to farmers as a mechanism to encourage uptake of DWPA mitigation measures on farms in England.Farm advisory services in England have dramatically changed over recent years, with concerns that the sector has become fragmented due to many organisations and businesses offering advice. This paper studies the role of various farm advisors and organisations providing one-to-one advice by interviewing 81 farm advisors in three agriculturally contrasting regions of England: East Anglia, the North West and South West. Objectives were to assess: which DWPA mitigation measures are being recommended by different advisors? How do recommendations differ between sources of advice and is there any conflict? And which mechanisms do advisors use to influence uptake of advice?Results from the interviews indicate that the advice delivered and the mechanisms used to influence uptake of advice vary between organisations and some advisors do indeed have particular roles within the farm advisory sector. Policy makers therefore need to consider not only what mitigation measures should be encouraged, but also which organisations and advisors are best placed to deliver on the ground advice to farmers. There is also scope to incorporate understandings of farm advice provision into catchment management plans to aid effectiveness of future agri-environmental policy.",,"[""Diffuse agricultural water pollution"",""Farm advice"",""Mitigation measures"",""Policy mechanisms""]",10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.03.007,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960106602,,0

The first animal and human stable isotope values from the Norwegian Stavanger region are presented in this study, revealing changes in dietary habits through a period of cultural, religious and economic changes in Norway, from the 9th century AD to the post-reformation period (17th century/early 18th century AD). 14C-datings of some skeletons that gave ages between AD 800-1150 (calibrated, 2 sigma) raise questions about their origin and the expansion of Christianity.

(Science, 338, 2012 and 1481) finally undertook an unprecedentedly comprehensive sampling of a tropical forest and demonstrated that plant species richness could indeed accurately predict arthropod species richness. We now require a high-throughput pipeline to operationalize this result so that we can (i) test competing explanations for tropical arthropod megadiversity, (ii) improve estimates of global eukaryotic species diversity, and (iii) use plant and arthropod communities as efficient proxies for each other, thus improving the efficiency of conservation planning and of detecting forest degradation and recovery. We therefore applied metabarcoding to Malaise-trap samples across two tropical landscapes in China. We demonstrate that plant species richness can accurately predict arthropod (mostly insect) species richness and that plant and insect community compositions are highly correlated, even in landscapes that are large, heterogeneous and anthropogenically modified.

The Lao PDR (Laos) has been reported to show early signs of such regime shifts in land systems with potentially major socio-ecological implications. However, given the complex mosaic of different land systems, including shifting cultivation, such changes are not easily assessed using traditional land cover data. Moreover, regime shifts in land systems are difficult to simulate with traditional land cover modelling approaches. A novel simulation approach was employed that focused on simulating changes in land systems rather than focusing on land cover. With the CLUmondo model we simulated three scenarios of potential developments between the years 2010 and 2030 assuming different degrees of international market integration and sustainable growth objectives. Although all scenarios show a decline of shifting cultivation systems, the respective orientation of markets and land governance resulted in strongly different land change trajectories. The land system changes are strongly location dependent and different trajectories are found in different parts of the country. Some scenarios show clear elements of land sparing with intensification of land management in the valleys and re-growth of forest on sloping land. Other scenarios show elements of enhanced multi-functionality. The approach addressed methodological challenges in simulating land system regime shifts and complex mosaic landscapes while accounting for societal demands for different types of goods and services from land systems. The land systems approach allows a nuanced representation of different types of forests and agricultural systems such as shifting cultivation and commercial agricultural plantations.

Animal Conservation published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of The Zoological Society of London.Projections by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and sea ice forecasts suggest that Arctic sea ice will decline markedly in coming decades. Expected effects on the entire ecosystem include a contraction of suitable polar bear habitat into one or few refugia. Such large-scale habitat decline and fragmentation could lead to reduced genetic diversity. Here we compare genetic variability of four vagrant polar bears that reached Iceland with that in recognized subpopulations from across the range, examining 23 autosomal microsatellites, mitochondrial control region sequences and Y-chromosomal markers. The vagrants' genotypes grouped with different genetic clusters and showed similar genetic variability at autosomal microsatellites (expected heterozygosity, allelic richness, and individual heterozygosity) as individuals in recognized subpopulations. Each vagrant carried a different mitochondrial haplotype. A likely route for polar bears to reach Iceland is via Fram Strait, a major gateway for the physical exportation of sea ice from the Arctic basin. Vagrant polar bears on Iceland likely originated from more than one recognized subpopulation, and may have been caught in sea ice export during long-distance movements to the East Greenland area. Although their potentially diverse geographic origins might suggest that these vagrants encompass much higher genetic variability than vagrants or dispersers in other regions, the four Icelandic vagrants encompassed similar genetic variability as any four randomly picked individuals from a single subpopulation or from the entire sample. We suggest that this is a consequence of the low overall genetic variability and weak range-wide genetic structuring of polar bears – few dispersers can represent a large portion of the species' gene pool. As predicted by theory and our demographic simulations, continued gene flow will be necessary to counteract loss of genetic variability in increasingly fragmented Arctic habitats. Similar considerations will be important in the management of other taxa that utilize sea ice habitats.",,"[""Arctic sea ice"",""climate change"",""dispersal"",""genetic variability"",""habitat fragmentation"",""inbreeding"",""polar bear"",""Ursus maritimus""]",10.1111/acv.12250,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954446410,http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1044595/FULLTEXT01,0

Besides, due to catalyst improvements and electronic mixture control of last generation engines, nowadays CO and HC cold start extra-emissions are heavily higher than emissions exhausted in hot conditions, with a clear consequence on air quality of the urban contexts. Ethanol combined with gasoline can be widely used as an alternative fuel due to the benefit of its high octane number and its self-sustaining characteristics. Ethanol, in fact, is well known as potential alcohol alternative fuel for SI engines, since it can be blended with gasoline to increase oxygen content, then decreasing CO and HC emissions and the depletion of fossil fuels. Literature data about cold emissive behaviour of SI engines powered with ethanol/gasoline blended fuels are rather limited. For this reason, the aim of this study is to experimentally investigate the effect of ethanol/gasoline blends on CO and HC cold start emissions of four-stroke SI engines: a last generation motorcycle was operated on the chassis dynamometer for exhaust emission measurements without change to the engine design, while the ethanol was mixed with unleaded gasoline in different percentages (10, 20 and 30 vol.%). Results of the experimental tests and the application of a new calculation procedure, designed and optimised to model the cold transient behaviour of SI engines using different ethanol–gasoline blends, indicate that CO and HC cold start emissions decrease compared to the use of commercial gasoline, with the 20% v/v ethanol blend achieving the highest emission reduction. Moreover, in this paper a review of the recent scientific literatures was performed on the emissive behaviour of SI engines fuelled with ethanol–gasoline blended fuels.","[""Calculation procedure"",""Cold start"",""Exhaust emission"",""Experimental investigations"",""Gasoline blended fuel"",""Gasoline blends"",""Scientific literature"",""SI Engines""]","[""Air pollution"",""Cold start transient"",""Ethanol–gasoline blends"",""Exhaust emissions"",""Motorcycle emissive behaviour"",""SI engine""]",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.144,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977098534,,0

Myocardial G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) is upregulated in HF patients, causing dysfunctional β-adrenergic receptor signaling. Importantly, myocardial GRK2 levels correlate with levels found in peripheral lymphocytes of HF patients. Objective: The independent prognostic value of blood GRK2 measurements in HF patients has never been investigated; thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lymphocyte GRK2 levels predict clinical outcome in HF patients. Methods and Results: We prospectively studied 257 HF patients with mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 31.4±8.5%. At the time of enrollment, plasma norepinephrine, serum NT-proBNP, and lymphocyte GRK2 levels, as well as clinical and instrumental variables were measured. The prognostic value of GRK2 to predict cardiovascular (CV) death and all-cause mortality was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model including demographic, clinical, instrumental, and laboratory data. Over a mean follow-up period of 37.5±20.2 months (range, 3-60 months), there were 102 CV deaths. Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide, and lymphocyte GRK2 protein levels were independent predictors of CV mortality in HF patients. GRK2 levels showed an additional prognostic and clinical value over demographic and clinical variables. The independent prognostic value of lymphocyte GRK2 levels was also confirmed for all-cause mortality.

Regarding size selectivity, shifting selectivity towards older/larger fish avoids both growth and recruitment overfishing and reduces unwanted catches. However, the benefits to fish stocks and fishery yields from increasing age/size-at-selection are still being challenged and the relative importance of selectivity compared to that of exploitation rate remains unclear. Consequently, exploitation rate regulations continue to dominate management. Here, an age-structured population model parameterized for a wide range of stocks is used to investigate the effects of selectivity on spawning stock biomass (SSB) and yield. The generic effect of selectivity on SSB and yield over a wide range of stocks is compared to the respective relative effects of exploitation rate and several biological parameters. We show that yield is mainly driven by biological parameters, while SSB is mostly affected by the exploitation regime (i.e. exploitation rate and selectivity). Our analysis highlights the importance of selectivity for fisheries sustainability. Catching fish a year or more after they mature combined with an intermediate exploitation rate (F ≈ 0.3) promotes high sustainable yields at low levels of stock depletion. Examination of the empirical exploitation regimes of 31 NE Atlantic stocks illustrates the unfulfilled potential of most stocks for higher sustainable yields due to high juvenile selection, thus underscoring the importance of protecting juveniles. Explicitly incorporating selectivity scenarios in fisheries advice would allow the identification of optimal exploitation regimes and benefit results-based management.",,"[""MSY"",""Age-at-selection"",""CFP reform"",""Exploitation pattern"",""NE Atlantic fisheries"",""Simulation analysis""]",10.1111/faf.12117,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929492213,,0

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Biological treatment of waste water from bulk drug production, contaminated with high levels of fluoroquinolone antibiotics, can lead to massive enrichment of antibiotic resistant bacteria, resistance genes and associated mobile elements, as previously shown. Such strong selection may be boosted by the use of activated sludge (AS) technology, where microbes that are able to thrive on the chemicals within the wastewater are reintroduced at an earlier stage of the process to further enhance degradation of incoming chemicals. The microbial community structure within such a treatment plant is, however, largely unclear. In this study, Illumina-based 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was applied to investigate the bacterial communities of different stages from an Indian treatment plant operated by Patancheru Environment Technology Limited (PETL) in Hyderabad, India. The plant receives waste water with high levels of fluoroquinolones and applies AS technology. A total of 1,019,400 sequences from samples of different stages of the treatment process were analyzed. In total 202, 303, 732, 652, 947 and 864 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained at 3% distance cutoff in the equilibrator, aeration tanks 1 and 2, settling tank, secondary sludge and old sludge samples from PETL, respectively. Proteobacteria was the most dominant phyla in all samples with Gammaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria being the dominant classes. Alcaligenaceae and Pseudomonadaceae, bacterial families from PETL previously reported to be highly multidrug resistant, were the dominant families in aeration tank samples. Despite regular addition of human sewage (approximately 20%) to uphold microbial activity, the bacterial diversity within aeration tanks from PETL was considerably lower than corresponding samples from seven, regular municipal waste water treatment plants. The strong selection pressure from antibiotics present may be one important factor in structuring the microbial community in PETL, which may affect not only resistance promotion but also general efficiency of the waste treatment process.","[""Anti-Bacterial Agents"",""Bacteria"",""Biodiversity"",""Drug Industry"",""Industrial Waste"",""Sewage"",""Waste Disposal, Fluid""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0165914,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994311247,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165914&type=printable,0

The impact of acetic acid membrane permeability on acetic acid tolerance in Z. bailii was investigated with particular focus on how the previously demonstrated high sphingolipid content in the plasma membrane influences acetic acid tolerance and membrane permeability. Through molecular dynamics simulations, we concluded that membranes with a high content of sphingolipids are thicker and more dense, increasing the free energy barrier for the permeation of acetic acid through the membrane. Z. bailii cultured with the drug myriocin, known to decrease cellular sphingo-lipid levels, exhibited significant growth inhibition in the presence of acetic acid, while growth in medium without acetic acid was unaffected by the myriocin addition. Furthermore, following an acetic acid pulse, the intracellular pH decreased more in myriocin-treated cells than in control cells. This indicates a higher inflow rate of acetic acid and confirms that the reduction in growth of cells cultured with myriocin in the medium with acetic acid was due to an increase in membrane permeability, thereby demonstrating the importance of a high fraction of sphingolipids in the membrane of Z. bailii to facilitate acetic acid resistance; a property potentially transferable to desired production organisms suffering from weak acid stress.","[""Acid tolerance"",""Lignocellulose"",""Membrane permeability"",""Molecular dynamics simulations"",""Myriocin"",""Acetic Acid"",""Antifungal Agents"",""Cell Membrane"",""Culture Media"",""Fatty Acids, Monounsaturated"",""Lignin"",""Molecular Dynamics Simulation"",""Permeability"",""Sphingolipids"",""Zygosaccharomyces""]","[""Acetic acid tolerance"",""Inhibitors"",""Lignocellulose"",""Membrane permeability"",""Molecular dynamics simulations"",""Myriocin""]",10.1002/bit.25845,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959495530,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/bit.25845,0

Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) is the reported treatment with the longest survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of perioperative systemic chemotherapy strategies on survival and postoperative outcomes in patients with DMPM treated with curative intent with CRS-HIPEC, using a multi-institutional database: the French RENAPE network. Patients and methods From 1991 to 2014, 126 DMPM patients underwent CRS-HIPEC at 20 tertiary centres. The population was divided into four groups according to perioperative treatment: only neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NA), only adjuvant chemotherapy (ADJ), perioperative chemotherapy (PO) and no chemotherapy before or after CRS-HIPEC (NoC). Results All groups (NA: n = 42; ADJ: n = 16; PO: n = 16; NoC: n = 48) were comparable regarding clinicopathological data and main DMPM prognostic factors. After a median follow-up of 61 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 40%, 67%, 62% and 56% in NA, ADJ, PO and NoC groups, respectively (P = 0.049). Major complications occurred for 41%, 45%, 35% and 41% of patients from NA, ADJ, PO and NoC groups, respectively (P = 0.299). In multivariate analysis, NA was independently associated with worse OS (hazard ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–4.94; P = 0.033). Conclusion This retrospective study suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy may delay recurrence and improve survival and that NA may impact negatively the survival for patients with DMPM who underwent CRS-HIPEC with curative intent. Upfront CRS and HIPEC should be considered when achievable, waiting for stronger level of scientific evidence.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols"",""Chemotherapy, Adjuvant"",""Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Hyperthermia, Induced"",""Injections, Intraperitoneal"",""Lung Neoplasms"",""Male"",""Mesothelioma"",""Middle Aged"",""Peritoneal Neoplasms"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Survival Analysis"",""Young Adult""]","[""Cytoreductive surgery"",""Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy"",""Peritoneal mesothelioma"",""Systemic chemotherapy""]",10.1016/j.ejca.2016.06.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979610056,,0

In this work, we have examined the impact of serum ANGPTL2 on improving cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A prospective, monocentric cohort of consecutive type 2 diabetes patients (the SURDIAGENE cohort; total of 1353 type 2 diabetes patients; 58% men, mean ± SD age 64 ± 11 years) was followed for a median of 6.0 years for death as primary endpoint and major adverse CV events (MACE; i.e. CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke) as a secondary endpoint. Patients with end-stage renal disease, defined as a requirement for dialysis or a history of kidney transplantation, were excluded. Patients were grouped into quartiles according to ANGPTL2 concentrations at inclusion: <11.2 (Q1), 11.2–14.7 (Q2), 14.8–19.5 (Q3) or >19.5 (Q4) ng/ml. Results: During follow up, 367 patients (representing 4.5% of the total person-years) died and 290 patients (representing 3.7% of the total person-years) presented with MACE. Both the survival and MACE-free survival rates were significantly different between ANGPTL2 quartiles (logrank 82.12, p < 0.0001 for death; and logrank 65.14, p < 0.0001 for MACE). Patients with ANGPTL2 concentrations higher than 19.5 ng/ml (Q4) had a significantly higher risk of death and MACE than those with ANGPTL2 levels of 19.5 ng/ml or less (Q1–3) (HR for death 2.44 [95% CI 1.98, 3.00], p < 0.0001; HR for MACE 2.43 [95% CI 1.92, 3.06], p < 0.0001) after adjustment for sex, age and established CV risk factors. Using ANGPTL2 concentrations, prediction of the risk of mortality, as assessed by integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), was significantly improved (IDI 0.006 ± 0.002, p = 0.0002). Conclusions/interpretation: In patients with type 2 diabetes, serum ANGPTL2 concentrations were independently associated with death and MACE. Therefore, ANGPTL2 is a promising candidate biomarker for improving risk stratification in type 2 diabetes patients, and may prove to be a valuable therapeutic target.","[""Aged"",""Angiopoietins"",""Biomarkers"",""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Myocardial Infarction"",""Prospective Studies"",""Risk Factors"",""Stroke""]","[""Angiopoietin-like 2"",""ANGPTL2"",""Biomarker"",""Death"",""MACE"",""Type 2 diabetes""]",10.1007/s00125-016-4066-5,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982899113,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00125-016-4066-5.pdf,0

All rights reserved.IMPORTANCE: Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning. OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results. FINDINGS: In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.","[""Age Distribution"",""Female"",""Global Burden of Disease"",""Humans"",""Incidence"",""Male"",""Neoplasms"",""Sex Distribution"",""Time Factors""]",,10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.5688,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018321414,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/102288/1/csc160002.pdf,0

Nowadays, these microorganisms are typically monitored by means of light microscopy, commonly combined with staining techniques. As drawbacks, these methods are susceptible to human errors, subjectivity and limited by the use of discontinuous microscopy. The in situ microscope appears as a suitable tool for continuous monitoring of filamentous bacteria, providing real-time examination, automated analysis and eliminating sampling, preparation and transport of samples. In this context, a proper image processing algorithm is proposed for automated recognition and measurement of filamentous objects. Methods: This work introduces a method for real-time evaluation of images without any staining, phase-contrast or dilution techniques, differently from studies present in the literature. Moreover, we introduce an algorithm which estimates the total extended filament length based on geodesic distance calculation. For a period of twelve months, samples from an industrial activated sludge plant were weekly collected and imaged without any prior conditioning, replicating real environment conditions. Results: Trends of filament growth rate-the most important parameter for decision making-are correctly identified. For reference images whose filaments were marked by specialists, the algorithm correctly recognized 72 % of the filaments pixels, with a false positive rate of at most 14 %. An average execution time of 0.7 s per image was achieved. Conclusions: Experiments have shown that the designed algorithm provided a suitable quantification of filaments when compared with human perception and standard methods. The algorithm's average execution time proved its suitability for being optimally mapped into a computational architecture to provide real-time monitoring.","[""Activated sludge plants"",""Average Execution Time"",""Computational architecture"",""Filamentous bacteria"",""Filamentous bulking"",""Filamentous microorganisms"",""Image processing algorithm"",""In-situ microscopies"",""Algorithms"",""Bacteria"",""Image Processing, Computer-Assisted"",""ROC Curve"",""Sewage""]","[""Digital image processing"",""Filamentous bacteria recognition"",""Filamentous bulking and foaming"",""Filamentous microorganism"",""In situ microscopy"",""Wastewater treatment""]",10.1186/s12938-016-0197-7,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977074275,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12938-016-0197-7,0

All rights reserved.The interest of archaeological research on the Phlegraean Fields, in the Gulf of Naples, has been often concentrated on different topics: monumental architecture, thermalism, coastal otium villas. However, we are still missing a reasonable reconstruction of the ancient landscapes of the area with special regard to the peninsula between Baiae and Misenum. The recent PhD project at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam has had the task of filling in the gap in local modern archaeology, and shifting the level of analysis from the “site” to the “territory”: the study of individual monuments and surviving archaeological assemblages of the Roman town of Misenum, the main harbour for the Imperial navy, is now a part of the investigation of the urban organization of the municipium. The use of a dynamic and multidisciplinary research strategy has led to the creation of a new archaeological map for the area being investigated. Furthermore, geophysical surveys over the area near the military port and the town centre has implemented the data available, contributing, for the very first time, toward a better and more detailed understanding of the organization of the harbour district, in relation with the political and civic core of Roman Misenum. Thanks to GIS applications it is now possible to launch an analytical examination of the urban fabric within the Misenum peninsula. On one hand, it has been possible to increase the amount of information at our disposal and, on the other hand, to propose a panorama of landscape dynamics for the Misenum territory whose massive amount of archaeological evidence appear to be extremely fragmented by human (modern urbanization) and natural factors (bradyseism).",,,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048369790,,0

Xinjiang is a high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence area in China. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and cure rate of tuberculosis among HIV positive patients in Xinjiang. Methods: In a retrospective study between 2006 and 2011, clinical and laboratory data on 333 patients with HIV and tuberculosis were compared to 2668 patients with HIV only. There were 31 HIV positive patients with no data on tuberculosis. Results: The prevalence of tuberculosis co-infection among the HIV positive patients was 11% (95% CI 10-12%), significantly higher than the national figure in China of 2%. In most cases HIV was diagnosed late, with advanced immunodeficiency. The use of isoniazid preventive therapy was only 57.9% in patients without tuberculosis who fulfilled the criteria for receiving this prevention. The cure rate one year after diagnosis was 69.2%, which was lower than the officially reported 91.4% in all tuberculosis cases in Xinjiang in 2011.

In outpatient children with a chronic disease attending special schools, this association has never been studied. The aim of this study was to assess the association between nutritional status and subjective health status in chronically ill children attending special schools. Methods: Overall, 642 children, median age 9.8 years (IQR 7.7–11.5), 60 % male, 72 % Caucasian, were included in this prospective study in nine special schools for chronically ill children in the Netherlands. Overall malnutrition was assessed as: acute malnutrition (<−2 SDS for weight for height (WFH)) and chronic malnutrition (<−2 SDS for height for age). The malnutrition risk was assessed with the nutritional risk-screening tool STRONGkids. Subjective health status was assessed with EQ-5D. Results: Overall, 16 % of the children had overall malnutrition: 3 % acute and 13 % chronic malnutrition. Nurses reported ‘some/severe problems’ on the health status dimensions mobility (15 %), self-care (17 %), usual activities (19 %), pain/discomfort (22 %), and anxiety/depression (22 %) in chronically ill children.

Wild P. monodon sampled at four locations off Bangladesh were studied using 10 microsatellite markers and 14 single nucleotide polymorphic sites (SNPs), including six unannotated regions and eight immunological genes (seven C-type lectin and one HLA3), of which variations were associated with tolerance to pathogens and survival in aquaculture. Three genetically distinguishable populations were observed, one in the eastern mangrove forest in the Sundarban–Barguna coast (south Bangladesh), the second in the Sundarban–Middle ground close to the delta of the river Ganges and the third at St Martin’s Island, southeastern Bangladesh. G“ST ranged from 0.042 to 0.093, and significant FST ranged from 0.004 to 0.011. A large proportion of individuals caught in Middle ground and at St Martin’s Island showed a genetic origin that was distinct from the other individuals at those sites, possibly from unsampled southern regions in the Bay of Bengal. Variation and the FST values for the SNPs from C-type lectin genes and HLA3 did not differ from the other markers studied, indicating no selective effects at these loci in the natural populations. Sustainable management of P. monodon should consider the population differentiation described in this study. Further assessment of signs of selection in aquaculture stocks could be useful for successful breeding of the species.",,"[""breeding"",""c-type lectin"",""Genetic diversity"",""management"",""pathogens""]",10.1080/17451000.2016.1196820,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979965037,,0

The reference device is a regional aircraft single slotted flap, enhanced with deforming capabilities to obtain improved hyper-lift performance. The design started with the identification of the internal architecture, intended to allow camber variations. A concentrated-hinge architecture was selected, for its ability to fit different curvatures and for the possibility of easily realizing an 'armadillo-like' configuration, then avoiding the use of a complicate deformable skin. The flap layout is made of segmented ribs, elastically hinged each other and span-wise connected by conventional spars. Relative rotations of the rib elements are forced by SMA structural actuators, i.e., cooperating in the external loads absorption. Super-elastic SMA are used to make up recovery elastic elements, necessary to regain the original shape after activation. These further elements in turn contribute to the overall flap rigidity. After assessing the hinge number and the size of the SMA active and passive elements, the advanced design phase was dealt with. It was aimed at solving manufacturing issues and producing the executive drawings. The realized demonstrator was finally tested in lab conditions to prove its functionality in terms of whether target shape actuation or attained shape preservation under loads. On the basis of the numerical results and the experimental outcomes, precious hints were obtained for further developments of the concept.",,"[""Flap"",""Morphing"",""Shape memory alloys"",""Smart structures""]",10.12989/sss.2016.17.5.819,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964624175,,0

All rights reserved.Inflammatory joint disorders (IJD), including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (ASp) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), are prevalent conditions worldwide with a considerable burden on healthcare systems. IJD are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) disease-related morbidity and mortality. In this review, we present an overview of the literature. Standardised mortality ratios are increased in IJD compared with the general population, that is, RA 1.3-2.3, ASp 1.6-1.9 and PsA 0.8-1.6. This premature mortality is mainly caused by atherosclerotic events. In RA, this CV risk is comparable to that in type 2 diabetes. Traditional CV risk factors are more often present and partially a consequence of changes in physical function related to the underlying IJD. Also, chronic systemic inflammation itself is an independent CV risk factor. Optimal control of disease activity with conventional synthetic, targeted synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs decreases this excess risk. High-grade inflammation as well as anti-inflammatory treatment alter traditional CV risk factors, such as lipids. In view of the above-mentioned CV burden in patients with IJD, CV risk management is necessary. Presently, this CV risk management is still lacking in usual care. Patients, general practitioners, cardiologists, internists and rheumatologists need to be aware of the substantially increased CV risk in IJD and should make a combined effort to timely initiate CV risk management in accordance with prevailing guidelines together with optimal control of rheumatic disease activity. CV screening and treatment strategies need to be implemented in usual care.","[""Anti-Inflammatory Agents"",""Arthritis"",""Atherosclerosis"",""Chronic Disease"",""Humans"",""Prevalence"",""Prognosis"",""Protective Factors"",""Risk Assessment"",""Risk Factors"",""Risk Reduction Behavior""]",,10.1136/heartjnl-2015-307838,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959449963,,0

All rights reserved.The United Nations listed maternal mortality as a major problem especially in developing countries. Predictive models that predict pregnancy complications have been suggested as an intervention to reduce maternal mortality but at the moment, many are not used in clinical practice. This study proposes a service-dominant perspective as an alternative use of predictive models to create value for maternal healthcare. We conducted an exploratory study in south-eastern Uganda in which we held semi-structured interviews with health practitioners to understand how the maternal healthcare system in Uganda works and how pregnancy complications are predicted. Results were analyzed using components from the service innovation framework. We find that overall, ICT has not been fully exploited to improve access to quality care, improve predictions and to improve collaboration among different practitioners in Uganda. Our findings suggest that by adapting a service-dominant perspective, we can enable predictive models and other technologies to assume an active role in maternal healthcare thereby supporting health practitioners with different skills and knowledge to predict pregnancy complications and hence trigger collaborative value creation. We believe that such an intervention will reduce maternal mortality.","[""Exploratory studies"",""Health-care system"",""Maternal mortality"",""Predictive models"",""Pregnancy complications"",""Semi structured interviews"",""Service innovation"",""Service-dominant Logic""]","[""Maternal healthcare"",""Predictive models"",""Pregnancy complications"",""Service-dominant logic""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058054761,,0

With the current rapid advances in technology, in particular low-cost high-throughput sequencing, it is now possible to develop molecular resources fairly rapidly. Wider sampling of biological diversity can only accelerate progress in addressing cellular mechanisms and shed light on how they are adapted to varied physiological contexts. Here we illustrate how historical knowledge and new technologies can reveal the potential of nonconventional organisms, and we suggest guidelines for selecting new experimental models.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background: Several studies have found that standard risk scores inaccurately reflect risk in TAVI cohorts. The assessment of mortality risk upon post-interventional ICU admission is important to optimizing clinical management. This study sought to determine outcomes and factors affecting mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to analyze and compare the predictive values of SAPS II and EuroSCORE. Methods and Findings: 214 consecutive patients treated with transfemoral TAVI (2006-2012) admitted to the ICU in an academic tertiary-care university hospital, were included in this retrospective data analysis. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 7%. Non-survivors at 30-days and survivors showed differences in the rates of catecholamine therapy upon ICU admission (93 vs. 29%; p<0.001), stroke (20 vs. 1%;p<0.001), sepsis (27 vs. 2%;p<0.001), kidney injury (83 vs. 56%; log-rank p<0.001), catecholamine therapy (88 vs. 61%;log-rank p<0.001) and vascular complications (60 vs. 17%; p<0.001). Mean SAPS II score and predicted mortality were higher in non-survivors (38.1±7.0 vs. 29.9±6.2;p<0.001 and 23.1±11.7 vs. 10.5±8.2; p<0.001, retrospectively), whereas the logistic EuroSCORE could not discriminate between the groups (p = 0.555). Among the biochemical parameters, the maximum values of creatinine, procalcitonin, and troponin I during the first 48 h after ICU admission were significantly higher in non-survivors. Multivariate analysis of baseline characteristics and complications associated with two-year mortality showed no significant results. Conclusions: The SAPS II is a good tool for estimating ICU mortality immediately after performing the TAVI procedure and provides valuable information for other known predictors of mortality.","[""Acute Kidney Injury"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Aortic Valve"",""Aortic Valve Stenosis"",""Calcitonin"",""Creatinine"",""Critical Care"",""Disease-Free Survival"",""Female"",""Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation"",""Humans"",""Intensive Care Units"",""Male"",""Postoperative Complications"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Assessment"",""Sepsis"",""Stroke"",""Survival Rate"",""Troponin I""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0167072,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84996553459,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0167072,0

In their place, phylogenetic trees can be calibrated by precisely dated geological events that have shaped biogeography. However, tectonic episodes are protracted, their role in vicariance is rarely justified, the biogeography of living clades and their antecedents may differ, and the impact of such events is contingent on ecology. Biogeographic calibrations are no panacea for the shortcomings of fossil calibrations, but their associated uncertainties can be accommodated. We provide examples of how biogeographic calibrations based on geological data can be established for the fragmentation of the Pangaean supercontinent: (i) for the uplift of the Isthmus of Panama, (ii) the separation of New Zealand from Gondwana, and (iii) for the opening of the Atlantic Ocean. Biogeographic and fossil calibrations are complementary, not competing, approaches to constraining molecular clock analyses, providing alternative constraints on the age of clades that are vital to avoiding circularity in investigating the role of biogeographic mechanisms in shaping modern biodiversity.

We wanted to investigate whether response to tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) translates into a reduced risk for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods: A cohort of patients with RA initiating a first TNFi 2001-2012 was identified in the Swedish Biologics Register. The association between European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response after 3-8 months of treatment (assessed using the first, the best and the measurement closest to 5 months, respectively), and the risk of incident ACS during the subsequent year was analysed in Cox regression models. Adjustments included cardiovascular risk factors, joint surgery, RA duration, education and work disability. Results: During 6592 person-years among TNFi initiators (n=6864, mean age 55 years, 77% women), 47 ACS occurred. The adjusted HRs (95% CI), which were similar to the crude HRs, of the 1-year risk of ACS among EULAR good responders compared with non-responders were 0.5 (0.2 to 1.4), 0.4 (0.2 to 0.9) and 0.5 (0.2 to 1.2), for the first, the best and the evaluation closest to 5 months, respectively. EULAR moderate responders had equal risk to that of EULAR non-responders, who, compared with the general population referents (n=34 229), had a more than twice the risk of ACS. For good responders, there was no statistically significant difference in risk versus the general population.

Both land surface temperature and precipitation observations of more than 10 years were analysed with a special attention to eight existing ice-core sites in the TP. The temporal correlation for the monthly or annual anomalies between any two points decreases exponentially with their spatial distance, and we used the e-folding decay constant to quantify the spatial scales. We found that the spatial scales are strongly direction-dependent, with distinctive patterns in the west-east and south-north orientations, for example. Meanwhile, in the same directions the scales are largely symmetric backward and forward. Focusing on the west-east and south-north directions, we found the spatial coherence in the first is generally stronger than in the second. The annual surface temperature had typical spatial scales of 302-480 km, while the annual precipitation showed smaller scales of 111-182 km. The majority of the eight ice-core sites exhibit scales much smaller than the typical scales over the TP as a whole.

This means placing people even more at the heart of Biosphere Reserve policy and management, and enabling people to become pioneers and ambassadors for realizing effective sustainability in all Biosphere Reserves. This also means that Biosphere Reserves and related institutions have to work towards true integration of their ecological, social and economic potentials, and set up a framework of genuine sustainability governance.

Significant outcomes of this work are the computation of a detailed spatial distribution of compounds in WWT basins and the quantification of the effects of the stirrer induced mixing on the evolution of compounds. SPH is a meshfree particle method which herein is applied to compute a treatment plant's reactor hydraulics. The characteristic feature of SPH is to describe a fluid's dynamics by particles that move along with the flow. The present WWT model takes advantage of this principle by assigning the compounds’ concentrations, which are defined by the activated sludge model no. 1, to SPH particles. A full-scale treatment plant simulation with a variable stirrer induced mixing intensity in the denitrification basin is performed. A spatial distribution of the compounds’ concentrations, which up to now was unknown for unsteady flows, is computed and analysed. The developed framework is generic and therefore expected to be applicable for modelling chemical engineering processes which are influenced by hydrodynamic effects.","[""Activated sludge model"",""Chemical engineering process"",""Hydrodynamic effect"",""Mesh-free particle methods"",""Mixing intensity"",""Process dynamics"",""Smoothed particle hydrodynamics"",""Smoothed particle hydrodynamics methods""]","[""Activated sludge model"",""CFD in wastewater treatment"",""Modelling of pollutant compounds"",""Process dynamics"",""Smoothed particle hydrodynamics method"",""Wastewater treatment simulation""]",10.1016/j.compchemeng.2016.12.020,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85008950136,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compchemeng.2016.12.020,0

METHODS: This retrospective study included 133 patients with type B AASs undergoing TEVAR; PIS was defined as fever >38°C, white blood cells (WBCs) >12.0/nl and C-reactive protein (CRP) >10 mg/dl within 72 h after TEVAR, despite negative blood cultures. Fibrinogen (FBG), D-dimer (D-d) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were also determined. The clinical endpoints were all-cause mortality and a composite of major adverse events (MAEs such as aortic rupture, need for reintervention and all-cause mortality) at follow-up. RESULTS: PIS was diagnosed in 15.8% of patients and was associated with higher peak values of WBC (17.0 ± 5.1 vs 10.6 ± 3.7/nl, P = 0.002), CRP (22.0 ± 5.4 vs 16.8 ± 8.2 mg/dl, P = 0.03), FBG (779 ± 246 vs 639 ± 225 mg/dl, P = 0.046), D-d (1675 ± 605 vs 1048 ± 639 μg/l, P = 0.003) and IL-6 (192 ± 101 vs 84 ± 34 pg/ml, P = 0.03) than non-PIS patients. All-cause mortality did not significantly differ between PIS and non- PIS patients during the index hospitalization (0.0 vs 6.3%; P = 0.60) and at follow-up (18.8 vs 4.9%; P = 0.086). MAEs were more frequent in the PIS than in the non-PIS group (62.5 vs 25.9%; P = 0.004).

The study area was divided into the oxic zone (60 to ca. 80 m water depth, O2 > 30 μM), the hypoxic transition zone (HTZ, ca. 80 to 120 m, O2 < 30 μM) and the deep anoxic and sulfidic basin (>ca. 120 m). Sediments in the HTZ were covered by mats of vacuolated sulfur bacteria. Ammonium (NH4+) fluxes in the deep basin and the HTZ were elevated at 0.6 mmol m-2 d-1 and 1 mmol m-2 d-1, respectively. Nitrate (NO3-) fluxes were directed into the sediment at all stations in the HTZ and were zero in the deep basin. PO43- release was highest in the HTZ at 0.23 mmol m-2 d-1, with a further release of 0.2 mmol m-2 d-1 in the deep basin.

All right reserved.Background Sepsis treatment has been associated with high costs. Furthermore, both the incidence of sepsis and the severity of illness at presentation appear to be increasing. We estimated healthcare costs related to the treatment of patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) and aimed to explain variability in costs between individuals. Methods We performed a prospective cohort study in patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic shock to the ICUs of two tertiary centres in the Netherlands. Resource use was valued using a bottom-up micro-costing approach. Multivariable regression analysis was used to study variability in costs. Results Overall, 651 patients were included, of which 294 presented with septic shock. Mean costs were €2250 (95% CI €2235-€2266) per day and €29,102 (95% CI €26,598-€31,690) per ICU admission. Of the total expenditure, 74% was related to accommodation, personnel, and disposables, 12% to diagnostic procedures, and 14% to therapeutic interventions. Patients with septic shock had higher costs compared with patients with severe sepsis (additional costs: €69 (95% CI €37-€100) per day, and €8355 (95% CI €3400-€13,367) per admission).

Version 3 of SOCAT has 14.7 million fCO2 values from 3646 data sets covering the years 1957 to 2014. This latest version has an additional 4.6 million fCO2 values relative to version 2 and extends the record from 2011 to 2014. Version 3 also significantly increases the data availability for 2005 to 2013. SOCAT has an average of approximately 1.2 million surface water fCO2 values per year for the years 2006 to 2012. Quality and documentation of the data has improved. A new feature is the data set quality control (QC) flag of E for data from alternative sensors and platforms. The accuracy of surface water fCO2 has been defined for all data set QC flags. Automated range checking has been carried out for all data sets during their upload into SOCAT. The upgrade of the interactive Data Set Viewer (previously known as the Cruise Data Viewer) allows better interrogation of the SOCAT data collection and rapid creation of high-quality figures for scientific presentations. Automated data upload has been launched for version 4 and will enable more frequent SOCAT releases in the future.

However, so far, occurrence data in the environment are lacking. Within this study NEB has been found for the first time in effluent samples of wastewater treatment plants in Germany with an average concentration of 13 ng L−1. Its photodegradation behavior in the environment and in technical processes is largely unknown. To fill this gap, three different UV treatment procedures (UV-C at 254 nm, UV-B at 312 nm and UV-A at 365 nm) were investigated in three different matrices: pure water, pure water in presence of the hydroxyl radical ([rad]OH) scavenger tert.-butanol and real wastewater. No elimination was observed during UV-A treatment. In contrast, NEB degradation during UV-B and UV-C treatment followed pseudo first order reaction kinetics, with highest removal rate during UV-C treatment in pure water (k = 7.8 × 10−4 s−1). The rate constant for UV-C irradiation decreased to 2.9 × 10−4 s−1 in the presence of the [rad]OH scavenger and in the presence of the wastewater matrix. The rate constant for the UV-B lamp was 4.4 × 10−4 s−1, Three transformation products were identified after UV-B and UV-C photolytic degradation using high resolution mass spectrometry. The main photoreaction is the substitution of the fluorine atoms of NEB by hydroxyl groups. A photolytic cleavage of the C[sbnd]F bond can be excluded as the high bond dissociation energy of aromatic C[sbnd]F bonds (525 kJ mol−1), exceeds the energy of electromagnetic radiation applied in the present study (≥254 nm, i.e., max. 471 kJ E−1). The quantum yields for NEB degradation for the UV-C lamp achieved in pure water, the [rad]OH scavenged system and wastewater matrix were Φdeg = 0.53, 0.19 and 0.22, respectively. For UV-B Φdeg was 0.023 ± 0.003, noticeable differences in quantum yield were not found. The photooxidation involves reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and singlet oxygen. These oxidative species may be formed upon reaction of photo-excited NEB with oxygen.","[""Bond dissociation energies"",""High resolution mass spectrometry"",""Nebivolol"",""Photolytic degradations"",""Pseudo-first order reactions"",""Reactive oxygen species"",""Transformation products"",""Wastewater treatment plants"",""Kinetics"",""Nebivolol"",""Photolysis"",""Ultraviolet Rays"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical"",""Water Purification""]","[""Nebivolol"",""Photolysis"",""Transformation products"",""UV"",""Wastewater treatment""]",10.1016/j.watres.2017.03.029,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015798277,,0

The ""normalcy"" of inhalant use in Mexico City is striking; streetwise inhabitants have knowledge about inhalants and inhalant users, and act accordingly. Users distinguish and classify a range of inhalants and sniffing techniques. Complicated patterns of inhalant use indicate the becoming of what are known as ""inhalant fiends"": formation within users of gusto, the acquired appetite for inhalants, and of vicio, the devotion to inhalants. An elaborate street culture of sniffing thus emerges: a complex configuration of shared perspectives and embodied practices, shaped by and shaping social exclusion.

Use of virus-specific T lymphocytes (VSTs) has been successful for the treatment and prevention of viral infections after HSCT for malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Here we describe the clinical use of VSTs in patients with PIDs at 4 centers. Objective We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VSTs for treatment of viral infections in patients with PIDs. Methods Patients with PIDs who have received VST therapy on previous or current protocols were reviewed in aggregate. Clinical information, including transplantation details, viral infections, and use of antiviral and immunosuppressive pharmacotherapy, were evaluated. Data regarding VST production, infusions, and adverse reactions were compared. Results Thirty-six patients with 12 classes of PID diagnoses received 37 VST products before or after HSCT. Twenty-six (72%) patients had received a diagnosis of infection with cytomegalovirus, EBV, adenovirus, BK virus, and/or human herpesvirus 6. Two patients were treated before HSCT because of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease. Partial or complete responses against targeted viruses occurred in 81% of patients overall. Time to response varied from 2 weeks to 3 months (median, 28 days). Overall survival at 6 months after therapy was 80%. Four patients had graft-versus-host disease in the 45 days after VST infusion, which in most cases was therapy responsive. Conclusion VSTs derived from either stem cell donors or third-party donors are likely safe and effective for the treatment of viral infections in patients with PIDs.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Child"",""Child, Preschool"",""Graft vs Host Disease"",""Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation"",""Humans"",""Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes"",""Immunotherapy, Adoptive"",""Infant"",""T-Lymphocytes"",""Viral Load"",""Virus Diseases"",""Young Adult""]","[""antiviral therapy"",""cytotoxic T lymphocytes"",""immunotherapy"",""Primary immunodeficiency""]",10.1016/j.jaci.2015.12.1311,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959178137,http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091674916001123/pdf,0

Participants were 497 Dutch families including the father (baseline Mage = 46.74), the mother (baseline Mage = 44.41), and their adolescent child (56.9% males; baseline Mage = 13.03). Each family member completed the SCC scale for six waves, with a one-year interval between each wave. Latent growth curve analyses indicated that adolescent boys reported higher SCC than girls. Furthermore, fathers and mothers reported higher SCC than their children, and it increased over time. Indices of SCC rank-order stability were high and increased from T1 to T2, T2 to T3, etc., for each family member, especially for adolescents. Multivariate latent growth curve analyses and cross-lagged models highlighted a unidirectional transmission process, with fathers’ and mothers’ SCC influencing adolescents’ SCC.

The incidence in Iceland is very low probably due to a low prevalence of cirrhosis. The only curative treatment is surgery, either transplant or resections, but only about 30% of patients are operable at the time of diagnosis. The aim of this study was to determine the number of patients who undergo liver resection due to HCC and to investigate outcomes after surgery at Landspitali University Hospital in Iceland. Material and methods: A retrospective study of all HCC patients, 18 years of age or older, who underwent surgical resection at Landspitali University Hospital from January 1st 1993 to December 31st 2012. Data was collected from clinical records. Descriptive statistical analysis was used. Results: During the time period 22 patients were operated with a liver resection and of those patients 12 (55%) had a major hepatectomy. 105 individuals in total were diagnosed with HCC in the time period, six patients had transplantation which results in 28 operations (27%). The average size of the tumors was 8.5 cm (3-22). Four individuals had cirrhosis. The frequency of intra-operative complications was 23% and post-operative complications 32% (Clavien-Dindo grade III and IV). A total of three individuals needed reoperation. The 30 day mortality rate was 0%. Twelve (55%) individuals were diagnosed with recurrence during the research period and eleven died. The one year mortality rate was 23%. Conclusion: The proportion of operable individuals with HCC in Iceland is low, few of whom have cirrhosis or other chronic liver disease. The mortality rate is comparable to other researches but the frequency of serious complications is higher probably due to tumor size.","[""Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"",""Hepatectomy"",""Hospitals, University"",""Humans"",""Iceland"",""Liver Neoplasms"",""Postoperative Complications"",""Reoperation"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Factors"",""Time Factors"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""HCC"",""Hepatocellular carcinoma"",""Liver surgery"",""Major hepatectomy""]",10.17992/lbl.2017.11.158,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034093425,https://www.laeknabladid.is/media/tolublod/1784/PDF/f01.pdf,0

In this study we investigated effects of single and combined exposures of silver (Ag) nanoparticles (AgNPs) and the synthetic hormone 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2) on tissue uptake of both contaminants in juvenile turbot (Scophthalmus maximus). Silver uptake and tissue distribution (gills, liver, kidney, stomach, muscle and bile) were analyzed following a 14-day, 2-h daily pulsed exposure to AgNPs (2 μg L−1 and 200 μg L−1), Ag+ (50 μg L−1), EE2 (50 ng L−1) and AgNP + EE2 (2 or 200 μg L−1+50 ng L−1). Effects of the exposures on plasma vitellogenin (Vtg) levels, EE2 and steroid hormone concentrations were investigated. The AgNP and AgNP + EE2 exposures resulted in similar Ag concentrations in the tissues, indicating that combined exposure did not influence Ag uptake in tissues. The highest Ag concentrations were found in gills. For the Ag+ exposed fish, the highest Ag concentrations were measured in the liver. Our results show dissolution processes of AgNPs in seawater, indicating that the tissue concentrations of Ag may partly originate from ionic release. Plasma EE2 concentrations and Vtg induction were similar in fish exposed to the single contaminants and the mixed contaminants, indicating that the presence of AgNPs did not significantly alter EE2 uptake. Similarly, concentrations of most steroid hormones were not significantly altered due to exposures to the combined contaminants versus the single compound exposures. However, high concentrations of AgNPs in combination with EE2 caused a drop of estrone (E1) (female fish) and androstenedione (AN) (male and female fish) levels in plasma below quantification limits. Our results indicate that the interactive effects between AgNPs and EE2 are limited, with only high concentrations of AgNPs triggering synergistic effects on plasma steroid hormone concentrations in juvenile turbots.","[""Androgens"",""Estradiol"",""Mixed exposure"",""Silver nanoparticles"",""Testosterone"",""Vitellogenin"",""Androstenedione"",""Animals"",""Estrone"",""Ethinyl Estradiol"",""Female"",""Flatfishes"",""Gills"",""Kidney"",""Liver"",""Male"",""Nanoparticles"",""Seawater"",""Silver"",""Tissue Distribution"",""Vitellogenins"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Androgens"",""Estradiol"",""Mixed exposure"",""Silver nanoparticles"",""Testosterone"",""Vitellogenin""]",10.1016/j.envpol.2016.09.067,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84998774594,https://sintef.brage.unit.no/sintef-xmlui/bitstream/11250/2459957/1/ENVPOL-D-16-01692%2bFarkas%2bet%2bal%2bpostprint.pdf,0

As an alternative to Western conservation theory, contemporary conservation theory emerged in the late twentieth century. It shifted the focus of conservation theory from the object to the stakeholders of that object. This is because an object has no rights, but stakeholders do, and it is for them that conservation is done.

Their true magnitude of species diversity and endemism, however, is still largely unknown as species diversity is traditionally assessed using morphological descriptions only, thereby ignoring cryptic species. This directly limits evidence-based monitoring and management strategies. Here we used molecular species delimitation methods to quantify cryptic diversity of the montane amphipods in the Irano-Anatolian and Caucasus biodiversity hotspots. Amphipods are ecosystem engineers in rivers and lakes. Species diversity was assessed by analysing two genetic markers (mitochondrial COI and nuclear 28S rDNA), compared with morphological assignments. Our results unambiguously demonstrate that species diversity and endemism is dramatically underestimated, with 42 genetically identified freshwater species in only five reported morphospecies. Over 90% of the newly recovered species cluster inside Gammarus komareki and G. lacustris; 69% of the recovered species comprise narrow range endemics. Amphipod biodiversity is drastically underestimated for the studied regions. Thus, the risk of biodiversity loss is significantly greater than currently inferred as most endangered species remain unrecognized and/or are only found locally. Integrative application of genetic assessments in monitoring programs will help to understand the true magnitude of biodiversity and accurately evaluate its threat status.","[""Amphipoda"",""Animals"",""Asia, Western"",""Biodiversity"",""DNA, Mitochondrial"",""Ecological Parameter Monitoring"",""Electron Transport Complex IV"",""Freshwater Biology"",""Genetic Markers"",""Genetic Variation"",""RNA, Ribosomal, 28S""]",,10.1038/srep22507,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959476330,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep22507.pdf,0

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Amphetamine dependence, besides its substantial economical consequence, is a serious cause of mortality and morbidity. By investigations of the neurochemical correlates through which addictive drugs, such as amphetamine, activate the mesoaccumbal dopamine system unique targets for treatment of drug addiction can be identified. This reward link consists of a dopamine projection from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) suggesting that these brain areas are important for reward. The physiological function of gut-brain peptides has expanded beyond food intake modulation and involves regulation of drug reinforcement. A novel candidate for reward regulation is the anorexigenic peptide neuromedin U (NMU). We therefore investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of NMU on amphetamine's well-documented effects on the mesoaccumbal dopamine system, i.e. locomotor stimulation and accumbal dopamine release in mice. In addition, the effect of accumbal NMU administration on locomotor activity was examined. The effect of NMU, icv or intra-NAc, on the expression of conditioned place preference (CPP) was elucidated. Firstly, we showed that icv administration of NMU attenuate the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation, accumbal dopamine release and expression of CPP in mice. Secondly, we found that a lower dose of NMU (icv) reduce the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. Thirdly, we demonstrated that NMU administration into the NAc block the ability of amphetamine to cause a locomotor stimulation in mice. However, accumbal NMU administration did not attenuate the amphetamine-induced expression of CPP in mice. Our novel data suggest that central NMU signalling is involved in development of amphetamine dependence.","[""Amphetamine"",""Animals"",""Conditioning (Psychology)"",""Dopamine"",""Drug-Seeking Behavior"",""Locomotion"",""Male"",""Mice"",""Neuropeptides"",""Nucleus Accumbens"",""Reward"",""Spatial Behavior""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0154477,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969580001,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154477&type=printable,0

Its primary and secondary prevention can result in a significant number of years of life saved. Aim: To assess how many years of life are lost after HCC diagnosis. Methods: Data from 5346 patients with first HCC diagnosis were used to estimate lifespan and number of years of life lost after tumour onset, using a semi-parametric extrapolation having as reference an age-, sex- and year-of-onset-matched population derived from national life tables. Results: Between 1986 and 2014, HCC lead to an average of 11.5 years-of-life lost for each patient. The youngest age-quartile group (18-61 years) had the highest number of years-of-life lost, representing approximately 41% of the overall benefit obtainable from prevention. Advancements in HCC management have progressively reduced the number of years-of-life lost from 12.6 years in 1986-1999, to 10.7 in 2000-2006 and 7.4 years in 2007-2014. Currently, an HCC diagnosis when a single tumour <2 cm results in 3.7 years-of-life lost while the diagnosis when a single tumour ≥2 cm or 2/3 nodules still within the Milan criteria, results in 5.0 years-of-life lost, representing the loss of only approximately 5.5% and 7.2%, respectively, of the entire lifespan from birth. Conclusions: Hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence results in the loss of a considerable number of years-of-life, especially for younger patients. In recent years, the increased possibility of effectively treating this tumour has improved life expectancy, thus reducing years-of-life lost.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"",""Databases, Factual"",""Disease Management"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Life Expectancy"",""Liver Neoplasms"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Primary Prevention"",""Prospective Studies"",""Registries"",""Secondary Prevention"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1111/apt.13554,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959479781,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/apt.13554,0

It influences matters of morality, ideology and decision making, which concern every human being at some point in their life. Although the different religions often lack a united view on matters such contraception and abortion, there is sometimes some dogmatic overlap when general religious principles are subject to the influence of local customs. Immigration and population flow add further complexities to societal views on reproductive issues. For example, present day Europe has recently faced a dramatic increase in refugee influx, which raises questions about the health care of immigrants and the effects of cultural and religious differences on reproductive health. Religious beliefs on family planning in, for example, Christianity, Judaism, Islam and Hinduism have grown from different backgrounds and perspectives. Understanding these differences may result in more culturally competent delivery of care by health care providers.

The role of workplace characteristics in nurses’ labor supply,"© 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.Empirically rigorous studies of nursing labor supply have to date relied on extant secondary data and focused almost exclusively on the role of pay. Yet the conditions under which nurses work and the timing and convenience of the hours they work are also important determinants of labor supply. Where there are national pay structures and pay structures are relatively inflexible, as in nursing in European countries, these factors become more important. One of the principal ways in which employers can improve the relative attractiveness of nursing jobs is by changing these other conditions of employment. This study uses new primary data to estimate an extended model of nursing labor supply. It is the first to explore whether and how measures of non-pecuniary workplace characteristics and observed individual (worker) heterogeneity over non–pecuniary job aspects impact estimates of the elasticity of hours with respect to wages. Our results have implications for the future sustainability of an adequately sized nurse workforce and patient care especially at a time when European healthcare systems are confronted with severe financial pressures that have resulted in squeezes in levels of healthcare funding.","[""Contracts"",""Databases, Factual"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Models, Econometric"",""Nurses"",""Salaries and Fringe Benefits"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""United Kingdom"",""Workload"",""Workplace""]","[""Compensating wage differentials"",""Nurses labor supply"",""Primary data"",""Worker heterogeneity""]",10.1007/s10198-015-0733-6,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84944542105,https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/8896/1/Nurses_BERESK_Final.pdf,0

Written accounts on urbanization outside of Rome are scarce and the archaeological record sketchy, especially during the tumultuous fifth and sixth centuries AD when Neapolis became the dominant city in the region. Here we show that isotopic ratios of lead measured on a well-dated sedimentary sequence from Neapolis' harbor covering the first six centuries CE have recorded how the AD 79 eruption was followed by a complete overhaul of Neapolis' water supply network. The Pb isotopic signatures of the sediments further reveal that the previously steady growth of Neapolis' water distribution system ceased during the collapse of the fifth century AD, although vital repairs to this critical infrastructure were still carried out in the aftermath of invasions and volcanic eruptions.",,"[""AD 79 Somma-Vesuvius eruption"",""Harbor geoarchaeology"",""Neapolis"",""Paleo-pollution"",""Pb isotopes""]",10.1073/pnas.1600893113,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973161077,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/22/6148.full.pdf,0

However, the literature on building LCAs consists of highly varying results between the studies, even when the assessed buildings are very similar. This makes it doubtful if LCA can actually produce reliable data for supporting policy-making in the building sector. However, no prior reviews looking into this issue in the building sector exist. This study includes an extensive literature review of LCA studies on the pre-use phase of buildings. The purpose of this study is to analyze the variation between the results of different studies and find out whether the differences can be explained by the contextual differences or if it is actually the methodological choices that cause the extremely high variation. We present 116 cases from 47 scientific articles and reports that used process LCA, input-output (IO) LCA or hybrid LCA to study the construction-phase GHG emissions of buildings. The results of the reviewed studies vary between 0.03 and 2.00 tons of GHG emissions per gross area. The lowest was assessed with process LCA and highest with IO LCA, and in general the lower end was found to be dominated by process LCA studies and the higher end by IO LCA studies, hybrid LCAs being placed in between. In general, it is the methodological issues and subjective choices of the LCA practitioner that cause the vast majority of the huge variance in the results. It thus seems that currently the published building LCAs do not offer solid background information for policy-making without deep understanding of the premises of a certain study and good methodological knowledge.","[""Background information"",""embodied"",""GHG emission"",""Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)"",""Literature reviews"",""Methodological knowledge"",""Scientific articles"",""Supporting policies""]","[""building"",""construction"",""embodied"",""GHG emissions"",""life cycle assessment"",""literature review""]",10.1088/1748-9326/aa54ee,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011422813,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/aa54ee,0

Although the guard-cell-signaling pathway coupling blue light perception to ion channel activity is relatively well understood [3], we know less about the sources of ATP required to drive K+ uptake [3-6]. Here, we show that triacylglycerols (TAGs), present in Arabidopsis guard cells as lipid droplets (LDs), are involved in light-induced stomatal opening. Illumination induces reductions in LD abundance, and this involves the PHOT1 and PHOT2 blue light receptors [3]. Light also induces decreases in specific TAG molecular species. We hypothesized that TAG-derived fatty acids are metabolized by peroxisomal β-oxidation to produce ATP required for stomatal opening. In silico analysis revealed that guard cells express all the genes required for β-oxidation, and we showed that light-induced stomatal opening is delayed in three TAG catabolism mutants (sdp1, pxa1, and cgi-58) and in stomata treated with a TAG breakdown inhibitor. We reasoned that, if ATP supply was delaying light-induced stomatal opening, then the activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase should be reduced at this time. Monitoring changes in apoplastic pH in the mutants showed that this was the case. Together, our results reveal a new role for TAGs in vegetative tissue and show that PHOT1 and PHOT2 are involved in reductions in LD abundance. Reductions in LD abundance in guard cells of the lycophyte Selaginella suggest that TAG breakdown may represent an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in light-induced stomatal opening.","[""Arabidopsis"",""Arabidopsis Proteins"",""Light"",""Plant Stomata"",""Triglycerides""]",,10.1016/j.cub.2016.01.019,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960432012,http://www.cell.com/article/S0960982216000695/pdf,0

Therefore, it is a potential trait of interest for crop plants, particularly in the context of variety selection for sustainable production systems. However, we do not have a good understanding of (i) whether there is significant variation in root-C deposition between varieties of important agricultural crops and (ii) whether variation in C deposition between varieties leads to major differences in C cycling in soil. In two experiments, we assessed variations in C deposition amongst barley genotypes and their respective impacts on microbial activity and SOM dynamics. In experiment 1, we applied 13C-CO2 labelling to selected barley recombinant chromosome substitution lines (RCSLs) and traced root-derived C in surface soil CO2 efflux, soil microbial biomass-C (MBC), soil solution, and soil particle-size fractions. In experiment 2, we conducted MicroResp analysis using 15 ecologically relevant C substrates to assess the impacts of barley genotypes on microbial activity. Soil respiration measurements (partitioned into plant- and SOM-derived components) revealed genotype-specific effects on plant-derived C, SOM-derived C and total C respired as CO2. For particle-size fractionation, we found that incorporation of plant-derived C to the silt-and-clay fraction varied between genotypes, indicating differences in relative stabilization of root-derived C as a result of barley genotype. Our data did not indicate genotype effects on total MBC size or dissolved organic-C (DOC) in soil solutions, but significant differences in plant-derived MBC and DOC were observed. MicroResp analysis showed differential utilization of 7 substrates (glucose, trehalose, lignin, arabinose, alanine, aminobutyric acid and lysine) revealing variation in community level physiological profiles (CLPPs) of soil microbes as impacted by barley genotypes. Furthermore, we found significant clustering of microbial CLPPs as a function of RCSLs and parent lines (Caesarea 26-24 and Harrington) suggesting a strong plant genetic control of the barley microbiome, and that this genetic control is heritable. Our results demonstrate barley genotype-specific effects on soil processes, revealing the potential for germplasm selection and variety improvement in barley to support sustainable production systems.","[""13C tracing"",""Microbial communities"",""Rhizosphere"",""Soil organic matters"",""Variety selection""]","[""13C tracing"",""C stabilization"",""Microbial community level physiological profiles"",""Rhizosphere"",""Soil organic matter priming"",""Variety selection""]",10.1016/j.soilbio.2015.12.011,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84953888921,,0

Ecosystem managers are required to address and mitigate the impact of multiple stressors, yet the knowledge required to disentangle multiple-stressor effects is still incomplete. Experimental studies have advanced the understanding of single and combined stressor effects, but there is a lack of a robust analytical framework, to address the impact of multiple stressors based on monitoring data. Since 2000, the monitoring of Europe's waters has resulted in a vast amount of biological and environmental (stressor) data of about 120,000 water bodies. For many reasons, this data is rarely exploited in the multiple-stressor context, probably because of its rather heterogeneous nature: stressors vary and are mixed with broad-scale proxies of environmental stress (e.g. land cover), missing values and zero-inflated data limit the application of statistical methods and biological indicators are often aggregated (e.g. taxon richness) and do not respond stressor-specific. Here, we present a ‘cookbook’ to analyse the biological response to multiple stressors using data from biomonitoring schemes. Our ‘cookbook’ includes guidance for the analytical process and the interpretation of results. The ‘cookbook’ is accompanied by scripts, which allow the user to run a stepwise analysis based on his/her own data in R, an open-source language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Using simulated and real data, we show that the recommended procedure is capable of identifying stressor hierarchy (importance) and interaction in large datasets. We recommend a minimum number of 150 independent observations and a minimum stressor gradient length of 75% (of the most relevant stressor's gradient in nature), to be able to reliably rank the stressor's importance, detect relevant interactions and estimate their standardised effect size.

Mesopredatory fish are key components in coastal food webs, and alterations in their abundance may have evident effects also on other parts of the ecosystem. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between the abundance of coastal mesopredatory fish, defined as mid-trophic level demersal and benthic species with a diet consisting predominantly of invertebrates, and ambient environmental variables in a fjord system influenced by both eutrophication and overfishing. A field survey was conducted over a coastal gradient comprising 300 data points sampled consistently for fish community and environmental data. Results from multivariate and univariate analyses supported each other, demonstrating that mesopredatory fish abundance at species and functional group level was positively related to the cover of structurally complex vegetation and negatively related to eutrophication, as measured by water transparency. Contrary to other studies showing an inverse relationship to piscivore abundance over time, the spatial distribution of mesopredatory fish was not locally regulated by the abundance of piscivorous fish, probably attributed to piscivores being at historically low levels due to previous overfishing. Mesopredatory fish abundance was highest in areas with high habitat quality and positively related to the abundance of piscivores, suggesting a predominance of bottom-up processes. We conclude that, in parallel with ongoing regulations of fishing pressure, measures to restore habitat function and food web productivity are important for the recovery of coastal fish communities in the area.",,,10.1007/s00227-016-2977-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84986213612,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc5014906?pdf=render,0

Scientists must therefore communicate across disciplinary boundaries. For this communication to be successful, scientists must write clearly and concisely, yet the historically poor standard of scientific writing does not seem to be improving. Scientific writing must improve, and the key to long-term improvement lies with the early-career scientist (ECS). Many interventions exist for an ECS to improve their writing, like style guides and courses. However, momentum is often difficult to maintain after these interventions are completed. Continuity is key to improving writing. This paper introduces the ClimateSnack project, which aims to motivate ECSs to develop and continue to improve their writing and communication skills. The project adopts a peer-learning framework where ECSs voluntarily form writing groups at different institutes around the world. The group members learn, discuss, and improve their writing skills together. Several ClimateSnack writing groups have formed. This paper examines why some of the groups have flourished and others have dissolved. We identify the challenges involved in making a writing group successful and effective, notably the leadership of self-organized groups, and both individual and institutional time management. Within some of the groups, peer learning clearly offers a powerful tool to improve writing as well as bringing other benefits, including improved general communication skills and increased confidence.","[""Communication skills"",""Disciplinary boundaries"",""Group members"",""Peer learning"",""Science writing"",""Scientific writing"",""Time management"",""Writing skills""]",,10.5194/hess-20-2965-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979599697,https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/20/2965/2016/hess-20-2965-2016.pdf,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. All rights reserved.STUDY QUESTION Does a progestin releasing subdermal contraceptive implant affect the efficacy of medical abortion if inserted at the same visit as the progesterone receptor modulator, mifepristone, at medical abortion? SUMMARY ANSWER A etonogestrel releasing subdermal implant inserted on the day of mifepristone did not impair the efficacy of the medical abortion compared with routine insertion at 2-4 weeks after the abortion. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN The etonogestrel releasing subdermal implant is one of the most effective long acting reversible contraceptive methods. The effect of timing of placement on the efficacy of mifepristone and impact on prevention of subsequent unintended pregnancy is not known. STUDY DESIGN SIZE, DURATION This multicentre, randomized controlled, equivalence trial with recruitment between 13 October 2013 and 17 October 2015 included a total of 551 women with pregnancies below 64 days gestation opting for the etonogestrel releasing subdermal implant as postabortion contraception. Women were randomized to either insertion at 1 hour after mifepristone intake (immediate) or at follow-up 2-4 weeks later (delayed insertion). An equivalence design was used due to advantages for women such as fewer visits to the clinic with immediate insertion. The primary outcome was the percentage of women with complete abortion not requiring surgical intervention within 1 month. Secondary outcomes included insertion rates, pregnancy and repeat abortion rates during 6 months follow-up. Analysis was per protocol and by intention to treat. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women aged 18 years and older who had requested medical termination of a pregnancy up to 63 days of gestation and opted for an etonogestrel releasing contraceptive implant were recruited in outpatient family planning clinics in six hospitals in Sweden and Scotland. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Efficacy of medical abortion was 259/275 (94.2%) in the immediate insertion group and 239/249 (96%) in the routine insertion group with a risk difference of 1.8% (95% CI -0.4 to 4.1%), which was within the ±5% margin of equivalence. The insertion rate was 275/277 (98.9%) in the immediate group compared to 187/261 (71.6%) women in the routine group (P < 0.001). At 6 months of follow-up significantly fewer women in the immediate group had become pregnant again (2/277, 0.8%) compared to the routine group (10/261, 3.8%) P = 0.018. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION For the main outcome loss to follow-up data was minimized through access to patient records. Efforts were made to reduce loss to follow-up also for secondary outcomes. The results of the sensitivity analysis did not differ from the intention to treat or per protocol analysis. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Guidelines on postabortion contraception should be amended to include insertion of the etonogestrel releasing implant at the time of mifepristone intake for medical abortion up to and including a gestation of 63 days.

However, the European Arctic is currently experiencing extensive environmental change. Glacial fjord systems, such as Kongsfjorden (Spitsbergen, Svalbard), are subjected to rising temperature, increased freshwater inflow from glaciers and melting snow and a changing ultraviolet (UV) radiation regime related to stratospheric ozone depletion. Thus, in addition to natural seasonality, sessile organisms require acclimation in order to adapt to an environment in transition. We examined the physiological and ultrastructural responses of A. esculenta to the combined exposure to hyposalinity and UV radiation. Photosynthetic quantum yield slightly decreased during a low-salinity treatment of 7 d. Exposure to UV radiation also lowered quantum yield, but specimens previously treated with hyposalinity were significantly less susceptible to UV than nontreated individuals. Concomitant with a loss of chlorophyll during the hyposaline treatment, phlorotannin and antioxidant contents were maintained, and samples treated with low salinities exhibited higher UV-screening characteristics as demonstrated by significantly higher absorption ratios at 300/680 nm. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a treatment-dependent swelling of cell walls and accumulations of phlorotannin-containing vesicles. Our findings point to a strategy by which kelps apply a fast and cost-efficient redistribution of phlorotannins rather than increased synthesis as a general stress response to different environmental drivers in contrast to stress-specific responses. The notion that acclimation to one stressor (low salinity) reflects increased tolerance towards a second stressor (UV radiation) supports the concept of 'cross-acclimation' as established for higher plants but not yet for seaweeds.",,"[""Alaria esculenta"",""Climate change"",""Hyposalinity"",""Macroalgae"",""Phlorotannins"",""Photosynthesis"",""Ultrastructure"",""UV radiation""]",10.2216/16-122.1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85033576089,,0

We report here a complete inventory of mercury (Hg) levels and speciation in the water column, atmosphere, sediment and key sentinel organisms (i.e., plankton, fish and birds) of two endorheic Lakes of the same watershed differing with respect to their size, eutrophication and contamination levels. Total Hg (THg) and monomethylmercury (MMHg) concentrations in filtered water and sediment of Lake Titicaca are in the lowest range of reported levels in other large lakes worldwide. Downstream, Hg levels are 3–10 times higher in the shallow eutrophic Lake Uru-Uru than in Lake Titicaca due to high Hg inputs from the surrounding mining region. High percentages of MMHg were found in the filtered and unfiltered water rising up from <1 to ∼50% THg from the oligo/hetero-trophic Lake Titicaca to the eutrophic Lake Uru-Uru. Such high %MMHg is explained by a high in situ MMHg production in relation to the sulfate rich substrate, the low oxygen levels of the water column, and the stabilization of MMHg due to abundant ligands present in these alkaline waters. Differences in MMHg concentrations in water and sediments compartments between Lake Titicaca and Uru-Uru were found to mirror the offset in MMHg levels that also exist in their respective food webs.

Finally, the increase of anthropogenic pressure in Lake Titicaca may probably enhance eutrophication processes which favor MMHg production and thus accumulation in water and biota.

In embryos of the chordate, Ciona intestinalis, three maternal factors—Gata.a, β-catenin, and Zic-r.a—are required to establish three domains of gene expression at the 16-cell stage; the animal hemisphere, vegetal hemisphere, and posterior vegetal domains. Here, we show how the maternal factors establish these domains. First, only β-catenin and its effector transcription factor, Tcf7, are required to establish the vegetal hemisphere domain. Second, genes specifically expressed in the posterior vegetal domain have additional repressive cis-elements that antagonize the activity of β-catenin/Tcf7. This antagonizing activity is suppressed by Zic-r.a, which is specifically localized in the posterior vegetal domain and binds to DNA indirectly through the interaction with Tcf7. Third, Gata.a directs specific gene expression in the animal hemisphere domain, because β-catenin/Tcf7 weakens the Gata.a-binding activity for target sites through a physical interaction in the vegetal cells. Thus, repressive regulation through protein-protein interactions among the maternal transcription factors is essential to establish the first distinct domains of gene expression in the chordate embryo.","[""Animals"",""beta Catenin"",""Blastomeres"",""Body Patterning"",""Ciona intestinalis"",""Embryonic Development"",""GATA Transcription Factors"",""Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental"",""In Situ Hybridization"",""Protein Interaction Maps"",""Sequence Analysis, DNA"",""T Cell Transcription Factor 1"",""Zygote""]",,10.1371/journal.pgen.1006045,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84974530721,https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1006045&type=printable,0

This treatment is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, improvement of patient selection is necessary. Assuming that the clinical phenotype is dictated by biological mechanisms, biomarkers could play a crucial role in this process. Since it is unknown whether and to what extent angiogenesis influences the course of disease in patients with PM, we investigated the expression of two angiogenesis-related markers and their relation to overall survival (OS) in CRC patients after CRS and HIPEC. Clinicopathological data and tissue samples were collected from 65 CRC patients with isolated metastases to the peritoneum that underwent CRS and HIPEC. Whole tissue specimens from PM were evaluated for versican (VCAN) expression, VEGF expression and microvessel density (MVD) by immunohistochemistry. The relation between these markers and OS was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Associations between VEGF expression, VCAN expression, MVD and clinicopathological data were tested. High stromal VCAN expression was associated with high MVD (p = 0.001), better resection outcome (p = 0.003) and high T-stage (p = 0.027). High epithelial VCAN expression was associated with MVD (p = 0.007) and a more complete resection (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, simplified peritoneal cancer index (p = 0.001), VEGF expression levels (p = 0.012), age (p = 0.030), epithelial VCAN expression levels (p = 0.042) and lymph node status (p = 0.053) were associated with OS. Concluding, VCAN and VEGF were associated with survival in CRC patients with PM after CRS and HIPEC. Independent validation in a well-defined patient cohort is required to confirm the putative prognostic role of these candidate biomarkers.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Biomarkers, Tumor"",""Colorectal Neoplasms"",""Cytoreduction Surgical Procedures"",""Female"",""Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic"",""Humans"",""Hyperthermia, Induced"",""Kaplan-Meier Estimate"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Neovascularization, Pathologic"",""Peritoneal Neoplasms"",""Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"",""Versicans""]","[""Angiogenesis"",""Biomarkers"",""Colorectal cancer"",""HIPEC"",""Peritoneal metastases"",""VEGF"",""Versican""]",10.1007/s10585-016-9779-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957954127,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10585-016-9779-9.pdf,0

We shed light on what would make them definitely accepted and more used by planners to evaluate a range of urban and transport policies. In addition to literature review and our own experience dealing with urban planning agencies, we have interviewed different types of end users in France to identify their motivations and barriers to use LUTI models. The results show demand for a far more bottom-up oriented approach: the models should consider objectives and general needs of end users to live up to their expectations.

The doubly ionized state was created by core ionizing the C 1s orbitals of the samples, rapidly followed by Auger decay. Due to the recent development of nitroimidazole-based radiosensitizing drugs, core ionization was selected as it represents the very same processes taking place under the irradiation with medical X-rays. In addition to the fragmentation patterns of the sample, we study the effects of methylation on the fragmentation patterns of nitroimidazoles. We found that methylation alters the fragmentation significantly, especially the charge distribution between the final fragments. The most characteristic feature of the methylation is that it effectively quenches the production of NO and NO+,widely regarded as key radicals in the chemistry of radiosensitization by the nitroimidazoles.","[""Core ionization"",""Fragmentation patterns"",""Medical X-rays"",""Nitroimidazoles"",""PEPIPICO"",""Photofragmentation"",""Radio-sensitization"",""Radiosensitizers""]","[""Core ionization"",""PEPIPICO"",""Photofragmentation"",""Radiosensitizer"",""X-ray absorption""]",10.1002/jms.3979,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040368610,,0

We see an OT-combiner as a 2-party protocol that can make several black-box calls to each of the n OT candidates, and we want to protect against an adversary that can corrupt one of the parties and a certain number of the OT candidates, obtaining their inputs and (in the active case) full control of their outputs. In this work we consider perfectly (unconditionally, zero-error) secure OT-combiners and we focus on minimizing the number of calls to the candidate OTs. First, we construct a single-use (one call per OT candidate) OT-combiner which is perfectly secure against active adversaries corrupting one party and a constant fraction of the OT candidates. This extends a previous result by Ishai et al. (ISIT 2014) that proves the same fact for passive adversaries. Second, we consider a more general asymmetric corruption model where an adversary can corrupt different sets of OT candidates depending on whether it is Alice or Bob who is corrupted. We give sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of an OT combiner with a given number of calls to the candidate OTs in terms of the existence of secret sharing schemes with certain access structures and share-lengths. This allows in some cases to determine the optimal number of calls to the OT candidates which are needed to construct an OT combiner secure against a given adversary.","[""Active adversary"",""Active securities"",""Minimizing the number of"",""Oblivious transfer"",""Passive adversary"",""Resource-efficient"",""Secret sharing schemes"",""Sufficient and necessary condition""]",,10.1007/978-3-319-70503-3_15,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85033787649,https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/545.pdf,0

Three approaches are compared in this study to capture climate impact, as well as and interfuel substitution between fuels, on residential fuel consumption for space heating in the Nordic countries. The first approach aims at directly estimating the demand for each energy carrier as a function of explanatory variables including heating degree days, fuels price and GDP per capita. The second approach is a two-stage model combing an econometric model for total energy use for space heating, and the market share for energy carriers based on cross/price elasticities, while in the third approach a set of simultaneous equations models were estimated. Based on the results of the mean average error and root-mean-square error criteria for three approaches across the Nordic countries, it was found that the second and third approaches were able to capture the complementary and substitution effects between fuels. This finding confirms our hypothesis that the interfuel substitution is a key factor for estimating changes in fuel demand and should be accounted for when residential energy demand is projected. The results additionally have important implications for climate change policy, by exploring the impact of fuel price on residential energy demand for space heating.","[""Bio-energy"",""Climate change policies"",""Climate impacts"",""Explanatory variables"",""Renewable resource"",""Residential energy demand"",""Root mean square errors"",""Simultaneous equations model""]","[""Bioenergy"",""Climate impact"",""District heating"",""Interfuel substitution"",""Renewable resources"",""Residential energy demand"",""Space heating""]",10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.184,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84953774808,,0

All rights reserved.Target identification remains a challenge for acoustic surveys of marine fauna. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, are typically identified through a combination of expert scrutiny of echograms and analysis of differences in mean volume backscattering strengths (SV; dB re 1 m-1) measured at two or more echosounder frequencies. For commonly used frequencies, however, the differences for krill are similar to those for many co-occurring fish species that do not possess swimbladders. At South Georgia, South Atlantic, one species in particular, mackerel icefish, Champsocephalus gunnari, forms pelagic aggregations, which can be difficult to distinguish acoustically from large krill layers. Mackerel icefish are currently surveyed using bottom-trawls, but the resultant estimates of abundance may be biased because of the species' semi-pelagic distribution. An acoustic estimate of the pelagic component of the population could indicate the magnitude of this bias, but first a reliable target identification method is required. To address this, random forests (RFs) were generated using acoustic and net sample data collected during surveys. The final RF classified as krill, icefish, and mixed aggregations of weak scattering fish species with an overall estimated accuracy of 95%. Minimum SV, mean aggregation depth (m), mean distance from the seabed (m), and geographic positional data were most important to the accuracy of the RF. Time-of-day and the difference between SV at 120 kHz (SV 120) and that at 38 kHz (SV 38) were also important. The RF classification resulted in significantly higher estimates of backscatter apportioned to krill when compared with widely applied identification methods based on fixed and variable ranges of SV 120-SV 38. These results suggest that krill density is underestimated when those SV-differencing methods are used for target identification.

This paper uses a trans-disciplinary approach to describe and analyse the intentional capture of waved albatrosses in northern Peru by offshore small-scale fishermen.

The removal of low molecular weights (LMW) and high molecular weights (HMW) PAHs was monitored in four bioremediation reactors and used as an indicator of the role of organic amendments in contaminant removal. The total initial concentration of LMW PAHs was 234 mg kg−1 soil (dry weight), while the amount for HMW PAHs was 422 mg kg−1 soil (dry weight). Monitoring of operational parameters and chemical analysis was performed during 20 weeks. The concentrations of LMW PAH residues in soil were significantly lower in reactors that displayed a mesophilic phase, i.e., 11 and 15 %, compared to reactors that displayed a thermophilic phase, i.e., 29 and 31 %. Residual HMW PAHs were up to five times higher compared to residual LMW PAHs, depending on the reactor. This demonstrated that the amount of added organic matter and macronutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the biochemical organic compound classes (mostly soluble fraction and proteins), and the operational temperature are important factors affecting the overall efficiency of bioremediation. On that basis, this study shows that characterization of biochemical families could contribute to a better understanding of the effects of organic amendments and clarify their different efficiency during a bioremediation process of PAH-contaminated soil.","[""Bacteria"",""Biodegradation, Environmental"",""Manure"",""Nitrogen"",""Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons"",""Sewage"",""Soil Microbiology"",""Soil Pollutants"",""Temperature""]","[""Bioremediation"",""Co-composting"",""Organic matter fractionation"",""Organic substrates"",""Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons"",""Spiked soil""]",10.1007/s11356-016-6635-z,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963751695,,0

However, conclusions for public health drawn from results of such molecular techniques are limited due to their inability to determine viral infectivity. Ethidium monoazide (EMA) and propidium monoazide (PMA) are capable to penetrate the damaged or compromised capsid of the inactivated viruses and bind to the viral nucleic acids. We assessed whether dye treatment is a suitable approach to improve the ability of qPCR to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious human adenovirus, enterovirus and rotavirus A in surface water of an urban river and sewage before and after UV disinfection. Like the gold standard of cell culture assays, pretreatment EMA-/PMA-qPCR succeeded in removing false positive results which would lead to an overestimation of the viral load if only qPCR of the environmental samples was considered. A dye pretreatment could therefore provide a rapid and relatively inexpensive tool to improve the efficacy of molecular quantification methods in regards to viral infectivity.","[""Azides"",""Enterovirus"",""Humans"",""Lakes"",""Propidium"",""Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction"",""Rivers"",""Sewage"",""Urban Renewal"",""Water Microbiology""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0167105,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84996550791,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0167105&type=printable,0

All rights reserved.This study uses individual-level longitudinal data from Iceland, a country that experienced a severe economic crisis in 2008 and substantial recovery by 2012, to investigate the extent to which the effects of a recession on health behaviors are lingering or short-lived and to explore trajectories in health behaviors from pre-crisis boom, to crisis, to recovery. Health-compromising behaviors (smoking, heavy drinking, sugared soft drinks, sweets, fast food, and tanning) declined during the crisis, and all but sweets continued to decline during the recovery. Health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fruit, fish oil, and vitamins/minerals and getting recommended sleep) followed more idiosyncratic paths. Overall, most behaviors reverted back to their pre-crisis levels or trends during the recovery, and these short-term deviations in trajectories were probably too short-lived in this recession to have major impacts on health or mortality. A notable exception is for binge drinking, which declined by 10% during the 2 crisis years, continued to fall (at a slower rate of 8%) during the 3 recovery years, and did not revert back to the upward pre-crisis trend during our observation period. These lingering effects, which directionally run counter to the pre-crisis upward trend in consumption and do not reflect price increases during the recovery period, suggest that alcohol is a potential pathway by which recessions improve health and/or reduce mortality.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Alcohol Drinking"",""Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)"",""Diet"",""Dietary Sucrose"",""Economic Development"",""Economic Recession"",""Fast Foods"",""Female"",""Health Behavior"",""Health Surveys"",""Humans"",""Iceland"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Smoking"",""Sunbathing"",""Young Adult""]","[""Economic crisis"",""Economic recovery"",""Health behaviors"",""Iceland"",""Recessions""]",10.1016/j.ehb.2015.11.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951800127,http://www.canadiancentreforhealtheconomics.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Asgeirsdottir-et-al1.pdf,0

LCNEC displays biological behaviors resembling those of small cell lung carcinomas and features of high-grade neuroendocrine tumors. LCNEC of the lung are considered aggressive. Reported prognoses are heterogeneous, and the optimum treatment remains undefined. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of all patients who were treated for LCNEC in our Department of Thoracic Surgery between May 2005 and December 2013. Primary outcomes of interest were patient survival and prognostic factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the significant predictors of overall survival. Results Within the prescribed period, 127 patients were treated for LCNEC, and 125 underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Induction chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy was given to 9 patients, and 63 patients received postoperative chemotherapy. Complete resection was achieved in 99.2%. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 83.7%, 63.2%, and 53.8% of all patients, and the 5-year survival in patients at stages I, II, and III was 64.5%, 40%, and 29.7%. There was a significant survival difference at 5 years between pT1/2 (58.5%) and pT3 tumors (22.4%; p = 0.043) and for patients with lymphatic involvement (L0 vs L1, p = 0.001; pN1 or pN2 vs pN0, p = 0.04).

Past studies have shown that aside from the level of economic development and rates of unemployment, other political, and economic factors systematically explain why certain European Union regions receive greater funding than others, in particular where there is room for bargaining. In this article, a novel theory is posited which argues that the determination of Structural Funds is based on an interaction between a region’s formal institutions (the level of a regional autonomy) and informal institutions (its level of quality of government). In cases of low regional autonomy, member states and European Union level actors prefer to allocate greater levels of Funds to regions with lower quality of government in order to increase cohesion. Yet in cases of high regional autonomy, risks associated with absorption failure in lower capacity regions lead states to strategically allocate greater levels of transfers to regions with higher quality of government. The theory is tested on data for 171 European Union regions for the 2007–2013 budget period.

One of the commercially most important examples of such a species in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean is mackerel for which up to recently only an international triennial egg survey contributed to the stock assessment. In this study, we explore whether fisheries acoustic data, recorded opportunistically during the English component of the North Sea International Bottom Trawl Survey, can contribute to an improved understanding of mackerel distribution and provide supplementary data to existing dedicated monitoring surveys. Using a previously published multifrequency acoustic mackerel detection algorithm, we extracted the distribution and abundance of schooling mackerel for the whole of the North Sea during August and September between 2007 and 2013. The spatio-temporal coverage of this unique dataset is of particular interest because it includes part of the unsurveyed summer mackerel feeding grounds in the northern North Sea. Recent increases in landings in Icelandic waters during this season suggested that changes have occurred in the mackerel feeding distribution. Thus far it is poorly understood whether these changes are due to a shift, i.e. mackerel moving away from their traditional feeding grounds in the northern North Sea and southern Norwegian Sea, or whether the species' distribution has expanded. We therefore explored whether acoustically derived biomass of schooling mackerel declined in the northern North Sea during the study period, which would suggest a shift in mackerel distribution rather than an expansion. The results of this study show that in the North Sea, schooling mackerel abundance has increased and that its distribution in this area has not changed over this period. Both of these findings provide, to our knowledge, the first evidence in support of the hypothesis that mackerel have expanded their distribution rather than moved away.",,"[""feeding season"",""fisheries acoustics"",""NEA mackerel"",""North Sea"",""Scomber scombrus"",""ships of opportunity"",""widely distributed species""]",10.1093/icesjms/fsv243,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964794826,https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/73/4/1115/7421501/fsv243.pdf,0

Stormwater discharge into water bodies significantly contributes to environmental pollution. The choice of suitable treatment technologies is dependent on the pollutant concentrations. Wastewater quality indicators such as biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total suspended solids (TSS), and total dissolved solids (TDS) give a measure of the main pollutants. The aim of this study is to provide an indirect methodology for the estimation of the main wastewater quality indicators, based on some characteristics of the drainage basin. The catchment is seen as a black box: the physical processes of accumulation, washing, and transport of pollutants are not mathematically described. Two models deriving from studies on artificial intelligence have been used in this research: Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Regression Trees (RT). Both the models showed robustness, reliability, and high generalization capability. However, with reference to coefficient of determination R2 and root-mean square error, Support Vector Regression showed a better performance than Regression Tree in predicting TSS, TDS, and COD. As regards BOD5, the two models showed a comparable performance. Therefore, the considered machine learning algorithms may be useful for providing an estimation of the values to be considered for the sizing of the treatment units in absence of direct measures.","[""Coefficient of determination"",""Environmental pollutions"",""Generalization capability"",""Pollutant concentration"",""Regression trees"",""Support vector regression (SVR)"",""Transport of pollutants"",""Treatment units""]","[""Machine learning"",""Regression Tree"",""Support Vector Regression"",""Treatment units"",""Wastewater"",""Water quality""]",10.3390/w9020105,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85013850149,https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/9/2/105/pdf,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus. All rights reserved.This study was designed as an external evaluation of the Steyerberg score in the prediction of different categories of postoperative mortality after esophagectomy on a large nationwide database of thoracic surgeons. Data collection was obtained from the Epithor national database encompassing the majority of thoracic procedures performed in France. We retrospectively compared the predicted to the observed postoperative 30-day (30DM), 90-day (90DM) and in-hospital mortality (IHM) rate in each decile of equal patient. Patients included in the study were operated for an esophageal cancer and Gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Steyerberg score was determined according to its logarithmic formula obtained from a sum score including age, comorbidities, neoadjuvant treatment and hospital volume. Deviation of observed from theoretically expected number of deaths was investigated using the calibration test of Hosmer-Lemeshow. Discrimination of the score was determined using the measure of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each category of mortality. Over a 9-year period, 1039 consecutive patients underwent an esophagectomy over 42 centers. Among them, 18 centers were considered as intermediate or high-volume institutions, and 24 were low-volume institutions. There were 841 males (81%) with a mean age of 62.3 ± 10 years. Preoperative treatment was allocated to 420 patients (40%). Numbers of comorbidity was: 1 in 261 patients (25%), 2 in 264 patients (25%), 3 in 383 patients (36%) and 4 in 5 patients (1%). The 30DM, 90DM and IHM rate were, respectively, 5.6%, 9.2% and 9.6%. The main causes of postoperative deaths were related to pulmonary complications (44%), complications of the gastric interposition (28%), cardiologic and thromboembolism events (10%). For 30DM, there were significant differences between predicted/observed mortalities in four deciles, whereas there was no significant difference for 90DM and for IHM. In term of calibration, there was a fair agreement of the Steyerberg score with observed 30DM. Predictions were above 20% for seven deciles. Calibration seemed more adequate for 90DM and for IHM. Predictions were above 20% for only three deciles but deviations were not significant. In terms of discrimination, for the 30DM the Steyerberg score overpredicted, the observed mortality rate and AUC was 0.64 (CI 95%: 0.57-0.71). For the 90DM, AUC indicated 0.63 (CI 95%: 0.57-0.68). For the IHM, AUC indicated 0.63 (CI 95%: 0.58-0.68). Steyerberg scoring system seems to be a moderate risk score of the prediction of the IHM and 90DM. This score appears to have a fair discrimination for the 30DM. Nevertheless, because of its simplicity, we believe that this simple predictive score is relevant and transportable to others institution performing such surgery for benchmarking purposes. A reappraisal of the score adapted to current surgical cohort is required.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Area Under Curve"",""Chemoradiotherapy"",""Comorbidity"",""Databases, Factual"",""Esophageal Neoplasms"",""Esophagectomy"",""Female"",""France"",""Hospital Mortality"",""Hospitals, High-Volume"",""Hospitals, Low-Volume"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Mortality"",""Neoadjuvant Therapy"",""Postoperative Period"",""Radiotherapy"",""Reproducibility of Results"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Assessment""]","[""Esophageal cancer"",""Esophagectomy"",""Hospital-volume"",""Mortality"",""Prediction""]",10.1111/dote.12447,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954494622,,0

Such high polyandry, in combination with female sperm storage, is likely to promote postcopulatory sexual selection among males. In addition, females may gain direct reproductive benefits from multiple mating. Investigating sexual selection in males and female benefits in relation to the number of sires, we put single virgin females in aquaria with one, two, five or ten males for 80 days, during which each female mated a majority of available males. After removal of the males, females continued to produce offspring during >1 year. Offspring genotypes of 27 families showed multiple paternity with 76 % of males contributing to juveniles, but paternity deviated from random with one or a few males siring the majority of the offspring. Larger males tended to be overrepresented among the sires. Female reproductive output (newborn or juvenile stage) did, however, not increase with number of sires, and females seemed not limited by the number of available males. Because previous studies have shown that females are seemingly indiscriminative in their mate choice, and given that they mate many hundreds of times in their lifespan, this suggests there is comparatively limited scope for premating sexual selection in this species. Hence, we interpret these results mainly in the light of postcopulatory sexual selection. Significance statement: Sexual selection is a main component of evolution. In that context, mating behaviour is central, although it sometimes appears puzzling, even maladaptive. For example, matings are costly; still, in some species, females mate multiple times and with numerous males. Why this behaviour has evolved is intriguing. Extensive numbers of matings suggest less efficient precopulatory mate choice, opening for postcopulatory sexual selection through cryptic female choice and sperm competition. Using a highly promiscuous snail species with internal fertilisation and long-term sperm storage, we identified the fathers of 549 offspring. We found that while females mated most males available, the offspring were non-randomly distributed among mated males and large males were overrepresented among the sires. This suggests that sexual selection predominantly occurs after mating and that males benefit from size-related effects. Yet, we could not find any female benefits from mating multiple males.",,"[""Bateman gradient"",""Convenience polyandry"",""Littorina saxatilis"",""Multiple paternity"",""Postcopulatory sexual selection""]",10.1007/s00265-016-2143-x,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968586475,,0

In partnership with the local administration of Oléron Island in France, a participatory simulation model was developed to foster social learning about coastal risk prevention measures with local authorities and managers. This simulation integrates a coastal flooding model and a spatially explicit agent-based model that simulates the development of the area and the management of prevention measures. The participatory set-up includes an immersive environment for participants to remember the coastal flooding simulation displayed and a role game mechanism that simulates the coordination issues between the different decision bodies involved in coastal risk management.

Helmke and Levitsky (2004) proposed an outcome-based typology for the interaction of informal institutions with formal ones. By using a structured approach for literature aggregation, we test the proposed typology of Helmke and Levitsky by applying this method to 74 empirical studies to investigate the influence of guanxi on formal institutions. We conclude that guanxi fits into none of the proposed categories perfectly. As a result, we propose the relationship between guanxi and formal institutions as auxiliary as well as competing concurrently, leading to convergent and divergent outcomes, respectively. Moreover, we propose a third category to add to the existing typology, namely 'formal institutions in transition'. We furthermore incorporate a dynamic aspect to the model by adding two further categories, concerned with the direction of the development.

Hence, there is a pressing need to assess the methodology used in contemporary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions directed at health literacy, in particular the quality (risk of bias), and the types of outcomes reported. Methods: We conducted a systematic database search for RCTs involving interventions directed at health literacy in adults, published from 2009 to 2014. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess quality of RCT implementation. We also checked the sample size calculation for primary outcomes. Reported evidence of efficacy (statistical significance) was extracted for intervention outcomes in any of three domains of effect: knowledge, behaviour, health status. Demographics of intervention participants were also extracted, including socioeconomic status. Results: We found areas of methodological strength (good randomization and allocation concealment), but areas of weakness regarding blinding of participants, people delivering the intervention and outcomes assessors. Substantial attrition (losses by monitoring time point) was seen in a third of RCTs, potentially leading to insufficient power to obtain precise estimates of intervention effect on primary outcomes. Most RCTs showed that the health literacy interventions had some beneficial effect on knowledge outcomes, but this was typically for less than 3 months after intervention end. There were far fewer reports of significant improvements in substantive patient-oriented outcomes, such as beneficial effects on behavioural change or health (clinical) status. Most RCTs featured participants from vulnerable populations. Conclusions: Our evaluation shows that health literacy trial design, conduct and reporting could be considerably improved, particularly by reducing attrition and obtaining longer follow-up. More meaningful RCTs would also result if health literacy trials were designed with public and patient involvement to focus on clinically important patient-oriented outcomes, rather than just knowledge, behaviour or skills in isolation.","[""Adult"",""Female"",""Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"",""Health Literacy"",""Health Status"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Quality Assurance, Health Care"",""Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"",""Socioeconomic Factors""]","[""Health literacy"",""Public health"",""Quality of Evidence"",""Randomised controlled trial"",""Risk of Bias""]",10.1186/s12913-016-1479-2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979032235,https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12913-016-1479-2,0

Yet a suitable sample preparation method that would enable extraction and enrichment of a wide range of such compounds from water is missing. The focus of this paper was to develop an enhanced solid phase extraction (SPE) protocol which enabled isolation of parent compounds and low molecular weight transformation products (that are produced after treatment of water with ozone) from different water matrices. Ten SPE sorbents were evaluated with regard to their ability to extract acidic, neutral, and basic compounds from water at several pH values. Highest recoveries (91–99 %) for all analytes in pure water were obtained by combining strong anion and cation exchangers of two manufacturers in a tandem mode without pH adjustment. Tandem Oasis (MAX+MCX) was finally applied to extract the spiked analytes from tap water, surface water, and several wastewater samples. The efficiency of the used SPE procedure was examined using an optimized liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–ESI-MS/MS) method using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. The occurrence of some of the investigated TPs in environmental water matrices was proven for the first time in this study. Method quantification limits (MQLs) for all compounds ranged from 3.7 to 15.3 ng/L in all matrices. Recoveries (%RE) were between 90 and 110 %. Intraday and interday precision, expressed as relative standard deviation, varied from 0.7 to 5.9 % and 1.8 to 10.3 %, respectively. Matrix effect (%ME) evaluation demonstrated that even complex sample matrices did not show significant ion suppression or enhancement. The applicability of the method was shown during two sampling campaigns at Ruhr river and a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) equipped with an ozonation step after regular biological treatment. The parent compounds were found in all water matrices at concentrations ranging between low nanogram per liter and low microgram per liter. Concentration levels of the detected TPs were in the lower nanogram per liter range. Their concentrations increased after ozonation of treated wastewater but decreased substantially after a polishing biological treatment in the final effluent and in the receiving surface water; thus demonstrating that occurrence at critical concentrations in aquatic ecosystems is rather unlikely.","[""Cation-exchange solid-phase extraction"",""Environmental water matrices"",""Micropollutants"",""Multiple-reaction monitoring modes"",""Relative standard deviations"",""Solid-phase extraction"",""Transformation products"",""Wastewater treatment plants"",""Anion Exchange Resins"",""Cation Exchange Resins"",""Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid"",""Molecular Structure"",""Ozone"",""Solid Phase Extraction"",""Spectrometry, Mass, Electrospray Ionization"",""Tandem Mass Spectrometry"",""Waste Water"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical"",""Water Purification""]","[""LC–MS/MS"",""Micropollutants"",""Solid phase extraction"",""Transformation products"",""Water analysis""]",10.1007/s00216-016-9523-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027956682,,0

Results The results indicated that transformational, active transactional, rule-oriented and participative leadership predict positive safety outcomes, and laissez-faire leadership predict negative safety outcomes. For example, rule-oriented leadership predicts a superior safety climate (β=0.40, P<0.001), enhanced safety behavior (β=0.15, P<0.001), and fewer accidents [odds ratio (OR) 0.78, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.62–0.98]. The effect of rule-oriented leadership on workers’ safety behavior was moderated by the level of participative leadership (β=0.10, P<0.001), suggesting that when rules and plans are established in a collaborative manner, workers’ motivation to comply with safety regulations and participate in proactive safety activities is elevated. The influence of leadership behaviors on safety outcomes were largely similar in Sweden and Denmark. Rule-oriented and participative leadership were more common in the Swedish than Danish construction industry, which may partly explain the difference in occupational accident rates. Conclusions Applying less laissez-faire leadership and more transformational, active transactional, participative and rule-oriented leadership appears to be an effective way for construction site managers to improve occupational safety in the industry.","[""Accidents, Occupational"",""Adult"",""Construction Industry"",""Cooperative Behavior"",""Denmark"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Leadership"",""Male"",""Motivation"",""Occupational Health"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Sweden""]","[""Accident"",""Avoidant leadership"",""Construction industry"",""Construction site manager"",""Leadership behavior"",""Occupational safety"",""Passive leadership"",""Safety behavior"",""Safety climate"",""Transactional leadership"",""Transformational leadership""]",10.5271/sjweh.3650,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021835748,http://www.sjweh.fi/download.php?abstract_id=3650&file_nro=1,0

Despite extensive investment in these changes, health systems still face a range of challenges which reform efforts do not seem to have overcome. The purpose of this paper is to argue that there are two particular reasons, which go beyond the standard explanations of changing demographics and disease profiles. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is a commentary based on the literature. Findings – The first explanation relates to the relationship between substantive health care reform and governance reform. These are intertwined processes and the pattern of interaction has distorted both types of reform. Second, reform has multiple meanings and may sometimes be more of an intra-organizational ritual and routine than a coherent plan aiming to bring about particular changes. As such, part of the reason why reform so frequently fails to bring about change is that it was not actually intended to bring about specific changes in the first place. The limited success of reform in recent years, the authors argue, has been a result of the fact that reform has focused too much on the substantive aspects of healthcare, while ignoring the governance aspect of the sector. Originality/value – As a result, governance has often been obstructed by interest groups inside the system, resulting in paralysis. The authors conclude by arguing that substantive reform of public organizations without an accompanying reassessment of the governance of these organizations are more likely to fail, compared to more comprehensive reform efforts.","[""Delivery of Health Care"",""Developed Countries"",""Health Care Reform"",""Policy Making""]","[""Change management"",""Governance"",""Policy"",""Political analysis""]",10.1108/JHOM-09-2015-0144,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960356536,,0

All rights reserved.New disruptive technologies are now emerging for detectors dedicated to adaptive optics. The detectors needed for this kind of applications need antonymic characteristics: the detector noise must be very low but at the same time must also sample the fast temporal characteristics of the signal. This paper describes the new fast low noise technologies that have been recently developed for adaptive optics. The first technology is the Avalanche PhotoDiode (APD) infrared arrays made of HgCdTe. In this paper are presented the two programs that have been developed in that field: the Selex Saphira 320x256 [1] and the 320x255 RAPID detectors developed by Sofradir/CEA LETI in France [2], [3], [4]. Status of these two programs and future developments are presented. Sub-electron noise can now be achieved in the infrared using the e-APD technology. The exceptional characteristics of HgCdTe APDs are due to a nearly exclusive impaction ionization of the electrons, and this is why these devices have been called ""electrons avalanche photodiodes"" or e-APDs. These characteristics have inspired a large effort in developing focal plan arrays using HgCdTe APDs for low photon number applications such as active imaging in gated mode (2D) and/or with direct time of flight detection (3D imaging) and, more recently, passive imaging for infrared wave front correction and fringe tracking in astronomical observations. A commercial camera solution called C-RED One, based on Selex Saphira and commercialized by First Light Imaging [5], is presented here. In addition, First Light Imaging also developed the C-RED 2 InGaAs 640x512 400 fps infrared camera for lower budgets. In the visible, another disruptive technology is showing outstanding performances: the Electron Multiplying CCDs (EMCCD) developed mainly by e2v technologies in UK. The OCAM2 camera, commercialized by First Light Imaging [5], uses the 240x240 EMMCD from e2v and is now routinely and successfully implemented on several world class telescopes.","[""Electron noise"",""EMCCD"",""HgCdTe"",""SAPHIRA"",""SELEX"",""Wave front sensors""]","[""Adaptive optics"",""APD"",""Avalanche photodiodes"",""EMCCD"",""HgCdTe"",""Infrared sub-electron noise."",""SAPHIRA"",""SELEX"",""Wavefront sensor""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049337031,,0

We present simulation results of three different model configurations (two different model versions at different grid resolutions) using two different atmospheric forcing data sets. Model version NorESM-OC1 corresponds to the version that is included in the NorESM-ME1 fully coupled model, which participated in CMIP5. The main update between NorESM-OC1 and NorESM-OC1.2 is the addition of two new options for the treatment of sinking particles. We find that using a constant sinking speed, which has been the standard in NorESM's ocean carbon cycle module HAMOCC (HAMburg Ocean Carbon Cycle model), does not transport enough particulate organic carbon (POC) into the deep ocean below approximately 2000m depth. The two newly implemented parameterisations, a particle aggregation scheme with prognostic sinking speed, and a simpler scheme that uses a linear increase in the sinking speed with depth, provide better agreement with observed POC fluxes. Additionally, reduced deep ocean biases of oxygen and remineralised phosphate indicate a better performance of the new parameterisations. For model version 1.2, a re-tuning of the ecosystem parameterisation has been performed, which (i) reduces previously too high primary production at high latitudes, (ii) consequently improves model results for surface nutrients, and (iii) reduces alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon biases at low latitudes. We use hindcast simulations with prescribed observed and constant (pre-industrial) atmospheric CO2 concentrations to derive the past and contemporary ocean carbon sink. For the period 1990-1999 we find an average ocean carbon uptake ranging from 2.01 to 2.58PgCyr-1 depending on model version, grid resolution, and atmospheric forcing data set.",,,10.5194/gmd-9-2589-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982719919,https://www.geosci-model-dev.net/9/2589/2016/gmd-9-2589-2016.pdf,0

Hypomethylating drugs such as azacitidine are active in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as monotherapy. Azacitidine monotherapy is not curative. The AML-AZA trial tested the hypothesis that DNA methyltransferase inhibitors such as azacitidine can improve chemotherapy outcome in AML. This randomized, controlled trial compared the efficacy of azacitidine applied before each cycle of intensive chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in older patients with untreated AML. Event-free survival (EFS) was the primary end point. In total, 214 patients with a median age of 70 years were randomized to azacitidine/chemotherapy (arm-A) or chemotherapy (arm-B). More arm-A patients (39/105; 37%) than arm-B (25/109; 23%) showed adverse cytogenetics (P=0.057). Adverse events were more frequent in arm-A (15.44) versus 13.52 in arm-B, (P=0.26), but early death rates did not differ significantly (30-day mortality: 6% versus 5%, P=0.76). Median EFS was 6 months in both arms (P=0.96). Median overall survival was 15 months for patients in arm-A compared with 21 months in arm-B (P=0.35). Azacitidine added to standard chemotherapy increases toxicity in older patients with AML, but provides no additional benefit for unselected patients.","[""Aged"",""Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic"",""Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols"",""Azacitidine"",""Cytarabine"",""Cytogenetic Analysis"",""Daunorubicin"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Induction Chemotherapy"",""Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Remission Induction"",""Survival Analysis""]",,10.1038/leu.2015.306,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959321350,,0

Inherent to the complexity of these underlying processes is that the dynamics of a system's evolution cannot be explained by linear cause-effect relationships and cannot be predicted under narrow sets of assumptions. Planning therefore needs to consider the functional behaviour and performance of integrated flexible infrastructure systems under a wide range of future conditions. This paper presents the first step towards a new generation of integrated planning tools that take such an exploratory planning approach. The spatially explicit model, denoted DAnCE4Water, integrates urban development patterns, water infrastructure changes and the dynamics of socio-institutional changes. While the individual components of the DAnCE4Water model (i.e. modules for simulation of urban development, societal dynamics and evolution/performance of water infrastructure) have been developed elsewhere, this paper presents their integration into a single model. We explain the modelling framework of DAnCE4Water, its potential utility and its software implementation. The integrated model is validated for the case study of an urban catchment located in Melbourne, Australia.","[""Flexible designs"",""Integrated modelling"",""Transition"",""Urban drainage"",""Urban water management"",""Australia"",""City Planning"",""Drainage, Sanitary"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Software"",""Urban Renewal"",""Water"",""Water Supply""]","[""Exploratory modelling"",""Flexible design"",""Integrated modelling"",""Transition"",""Urban drainage"",""Urban water management""]",10.1016/j.watres.2017.09.039,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030830332,,0

Design/methodology/approach: The author collected and described questionnaires used by the universities of the Regional Observatory of Campania University System. These questionnaires are given by the host institutions to interns to fill out, and they evaluate skills growth in terms of initial and final assessment. Data related to these questionnaires are not publicly available, therefore the main data source comes from 732 post-internship questionnaires collected by the University of Suor Orsola Benincasa in 2013-2014. Findings: Out of the 732 participants considered, 65 per cent rated excellent for motivation and interest, 55 per cent were rated excellent for the responsibility demonstrated, but only 37 per cent were rated excellent for the level of work autonomy achieved: a signal of the need to better prepare students for internships. Cross-technical and professional skills, which increase of +37 and +32 per cent, suggest that the experience has a very positive value. Regarding the experience outcome, the author detected a positive indicator: in 6 per cent of cases, an early employment occurred. Research limitations/implications: It has only been possible to analyze the questionnaires from one of the Campania universities.

Its primary and secondary prevention can result in a significant number of years of life saved. Aim: To assess how many years of life are lost after HCC diagnosis. Methods: Data from 5346 patients with first HCC diagnosis were used to estimate lifespan and number of years of life lost after tumour onset, using a semi-parametric extrapolation having as reference an age-, sex- and year-of-onset-matched population derived from national life tables. Results: Between 1986 and 2014, HCC lead to an average of 11.5 years-of-life lost for each patient. The youngest age-quartile group (18-61 years) had the highest number of years-of-life lost, representing approximately 41% of the overall benefit obtainable from prevention. Advancements in HCC management have progressively reduced the number of years-of-life lost from 12.6 years in 1986-1999, to 10.7 in 2000-2006 and 7.4 years in 2007-2014. Currently, an HCC diagnosis when a single tumour <2 cm results in 3.7 years-of-life lost while the diagnosis when a single tumour ≥2 cm or 2/3 nodules still within the Milan criteria, results in 5.0 years-of-life lost, representing the loss of only approximately 5.5% and 7.2%, respectively, of the entire lifespan from birth. Conclusions: Hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence results in the loss of a considerable number of years-of-life, especially for younger patients. In recent years, the increased possibility of effectively treating this tumour has improved life expectancy, thus reducing years-of-life lost.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"",""Databases, Factual"",""Disease Management"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Life Expectancy"",""Liver Neoplasms"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Primary Prevention"",""Prospective Studies"",""Registries"",""Secondary Prevention"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1111/apt.13554,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959479781,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/apt.13554,0

Methods: Health care professionals (HCPs) were invited to participate and to recruit TLPs. TLPs were informed on the self-care education program “In Tune without Cords” (ITwC) after which they gained access. A study specific survey was used (at baseline T0 and postintervention T1) on TLPs’ uptake. Usage, satisfaction (general impression, willingness to use, user-friendliness, satisfaction with self-care advice and strategies, Net Promoter Score (NPS)), sociodemographic, and clinical factors were analyzed. Results: HCPs of 6 out of 9 centers (67 % uptake rate) agreed to participate and recruited TLPs. In total, 55 of 75 TLPs returned informed consent and the baseline T0 survey and were provided access to ITwC (73 % uptake rate). Thirty-eight of these 55 TLPs used ITwC and completed the T1 survey (69 % usage rate). Most (66 %) TLPs were satisfied (i.e., score ≥7 (scale 1–10) on 4 survey items) with the self-care education program (mean score 7.2, SD 1.1). NPS was positive (+5). Satisfaction with the self-care education program was significantly associated with (higher) educational level and health literacy skills (P =.004, P =.038, respectively). No significant association was found with gender, age, marital status, employment status, Internet use, Internet literacy, treatment modality, time since total laryngectomy, and quality of life.

Schistosomiasis, a NTD, is a tropical and subtropical disease caused by the trematode Schistosoma mansoni (Africa, Middle East, Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname), japonicum (China, Indonesia, the Philippines), mekongi (several districts of Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic), intercalatum and guianensis (areas of tropical rainforests in Central Africa) and hematobium (Middle East Africa, Corsica, France) whose adult forms inhabit the mesenteric vessels of the host, while the intermediate forms are found in the aquatic gastropod snails of the genus Biomphalaria. Currently, praziquantel (PZQ) is the first line drug chosen for the treatment of schistosomiasis according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines, 2015. PZQ chemotherapy is considered to be the most important development for decades in the treatment of schistosomiasis. Beside the PZQ, oxamniquine (OXA) has been first described in 1969 and launched in Brazil by Pfizer under the name of Mansil® for oral administration. It has a lower cost when compared to PZQ, being active in the intestinal and hepatosplenic infections caused exclusively by S. mansoni, single species in Brazil. Both PZQ and OXA have limitations, as low efficacy in the treatment of acute schistosomiasis, low activity against S. mansoni in immature stages and resistance or tolerance, which is the reason why further research are still necessary for the development of a second generation of antischistosomal drugs. For the development of new PZQ analogs, three main strategies can be adopted: (a) synthesis and evaluation of PZQ analogues; (b) rational design of new pharmacophores; (c) discovery of new active compounds from screening programs on a large scale. Such (b) approach is difficult as the target of PZQ still unknown, the synthesis of new active analogues is possible from delineation of structure-activity relationships for PZQ. Thus, we proposed for a review article an accurate analysis of PZQ and OXA medicinal properties and uses, focusing on the pharmacochemical aspects of both drugs through 178 bibliographic references. The mechanisms of action will be discussed, with the latest information available in the literature (for the first time in the case of the oxamniquine). Cases of resistance are also discussed. As both drugs are available as a racemic mixture the biological impact of their stereochemistry to activity and side effects are reviewed. The results obtained for the combination of PZQ and artemisinin derivatives against immature worms are also introduced in the discussion. Using the information about more than 200 PZQ new derivatives synthetized during almost 35 years since its discovery, a deep structure-activity relationship (SAR) is also proposed in this study.","[""Animals"",""Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"",""Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"",""Humans"",""Molecular Structure"",""Neglected Diseases"",""Oxamniquine"",""Praziquantel"",""Schistosoma mansoni"",""Structure-Activity Relationship""]","[""Medicinal chemistry"",""Oxamniquine"",""Praziquantel"",""Schistosomiasis""]",10.1016/j.bmc.2017.04.031,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019019520,,0

One reason is the growing recognition that, in seeking explanations for rising income inequality, we need to look not only at wages and earned income but also at income from capital, particularly at the top of the distribution. In this paper, we use evidence from existing data sources to attempt to answer three questions: (i) What is the share of total personal wealth that is owned by the top 1 per cent, or the top 0.1 per cent? (ii) Is wealth much more unequally distributed than income? (iii) Is the concentration of wealth at the top increasing over time?

In this respect, salinity is a key factor influencing species distributions and community structure in aquatic animals. Nevertheless, the effects of salinity on reproductive behaviours are not well known. Here, we used the sand goby (Pomatoschistus minutus), a small fish inhabiting a range of different salinities, to experimentally assess the effects of changes in salinity on nesting behaviour, a key component of reproduction in sand gobies and many other taxa. Results: We found that salinity levels influenced some aspects of male nesting behaviour (i.e. nest entrance size) but not others (i.e. latency to build a nest, choice of nest site, sand on top of nest) and that small and large individuals were differently affected. In particular, the importance of body size in adjustment of nest entrance depended on the salinity level. Conclusion: The results support the prediction that geographically widespread aquatic species, such as sand gobies, are able to perform well under a range of salinity levels. The phenotype by environment interaction found between male size and behavioural responses to salinity can, in turn, help to explain the notable variation observed in nest-building (and other) behaviours closely linked to reproduction.","[""Animals"",""Male"",""Nesting Behavior"",""Perciformes"",""Salinity""]","[""Body size"",""Environmental change"",""Nest-building"",""Parental care"",""Phenotypic plasticity"",""Salinity"",""Sand goby""]",10.1186/s12898-016-0067-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962082396,https://bmcecol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12898-016-0067-y,0

The importance of policy, however, has received limited attention and accordingly, the role of policy for the emergence and development of new regional industrial growth paths remains largely unexplored. This paper takes an institutional perspective and suggests that the regional innovation system approach can contribute to conceptualising and analysing the role of policy for new regional industrial path development. We argue that in order to turn regional preconditions into new growth paths, regional innovation systems require strong policy capacities, consisting of formal and governance capacities. In the empirical part, we analyse the emergence and further development of two new growth paths in the region of Scania in southern Sweden, namely biogas and new media. Based on personal interviews with policy makers, representatives from knowledge and supporting organisations and firms as well as a document analysis, we investigate how policy interventions have influenced the rise and evolution of these two industries. We show that in both cases, policy-led initiatives have played an important role in enabling new path development.We find that policy can play multiple roles in nurturing and maintaining new growth paths and that these are closely interlinked with particular policy capacities of regional innovation systems.",,"[""Capacity building"",""New path development"",""Regional innovation system"",""Regional policy""]",10.1177/0263774X16665845,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019871416,http://wp.circle.lu.se/upload/CIRCLE/workingpapers/201625_martin_et_al.pdf,0

With increasing pressures of a changing climate, urban growth and economic constraints, the need for wider spread integration is necessary in the interest of a sustainable future. Greater complexity results in greater computational burden but modelling packages will, likewise, need to be flexible enough to allow incorporation of new algorithms. With advancements in modern information technology, a parallel implementation of such a modelling toolkit is mandatory while still leaving its users the flexibility of extensions. The design and implementation of the integrated modelling framework CityDrain3 shows that it is possible to write research code that is high-performance and extensible by many research projects. Three use case scenarios are presented to showcase the application of CityDrain3. The performance advantage of parallelization (up to 40 times compared to its predecessor) and the scalability of the framework are also demonstrated.","[""Design and implementations"",""Modern information technologies"",""Multi core"",""Object oriented design"",""Parallel implementations"",""Simulation framework"",""Urban drainage"",""Urban drainage modelling""]","[""Integrated urban drainage"",""Modelling"",""Multi-core"",""Object-oriented design"",""Parallel computing"",""Simulation framework""]",10.1016/j.advengsoft.2016.08.004,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84981274844,,0

The syndrome is associated with increased mortality and impaired quality of life because of the occurrence of comorbidities. These clinical complications include metabolic syndrome, consisting of systemic arterial hypertension, visceral obesity, impairment of glucose metabolism, and dyslipidaemia; musculoskeletal disorders, such as myopathy, osteoporosis, and skeletal fractures; neuropsychiatric disorders, such as impairment of cognitive function, depression, or mania; impairment of reproductive and sexual function; and dermatological manifestations, mainly represented by acne, hirsutism, and alopecia. Hypertension in patients with Cushing's syndrome has a multifactorial pathogenesis and contributes to the increased risk for myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, or stroke, which are the most common causes of death; risks of these outcomes are exacerbated by a prothrombotic diathesis and hypokalaemia. Neuropsychiatric disorders can be responsible for suicide. Immune disorders are common; immunosuppression during active disease causes susceptibility to infections, possibly complicated by sepsis, an important cause of death, whereas immune rebound after disease remission can exacerbate underlying autoimmune diseases. Prompt treatment of cortisol excess and specific treatments of comorbidities are crucial to prevent serious clinical complications and reduce the mortality associated with Cushing's syndrome.","[""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Cushing Syndrome"",""Humans"",""Immune System Diseases"",""Mental Disorders"",""Metabolic Syndrome"",""Musculoskeletal Diseases"",""Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological""]",,10.1016/S2213-8587(16)00086-3,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84970015485,https://iris.uniroma1.it/retrieve/handle/11573/869810/281375/Pivonello_Complications-Cushing%e2%80%99s-syndrome_2016.pdf,0

In this study we evaluate the impacts of LULC changes on rockfall hazards on the slopes above the village of Crolles (Chartreuse massif, Grenoble conurbation, French Alps) through a three-level approach: (i) diachronic landscape analysis for four different periods of the past (i.e. 1850, 1956, 1975, and 2013), (ii) computation of 3D rockfall simulations taking explicitly account of reconstructed LULC changes, and (iii) resulting changes in rockfall hazards over time. We reveal that the disappearance of viticultural landscapes (relating to the decline of cropping areas during the interwar period) and intense afforestation of the steepest upper portion of the slope resulted in a significant increase of rockfall return period associated to a gradual decrease of mean kinetic energy at the level of the urban front of Crolles. According to the Eurobloc methodology, the degree of hazard decreased significantly despite the continuous and rapid urban sprawl on the slopes. These results underline that forests can indeed have significant protection function but also call for a more systematic inclusion of LULC changes in hazard assessments in the future.","[""Land use and land cover"",""Land use and land cover change"",""Peri-alpine conurbation"",""Protection forests"",""Protection function"",""Rockfalls"",""Three-level approach"",""Viticultural landscapes""]","[""Land use and land cover changes"",""Peri-alpine conurbation"",""Protection forest"",""Rockfall modeling"",""Rockfall propagations""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.148,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84953791073,,0

This study aimed to study the incidence of MNM and quality of care at a district hospital in rural Rwanda by applying this approach. Methods: A facility based, prospective cohort study conducted at a district hospital in rural Rwanda between June 2013 and December 2014. Subjects were followed from time of admission to discharge or death. Results: In 3979 deliveries, 3827 singletons and 152 twins pairs were born. Among the 4131 neonates, there were 3994 live births and 137 stillbirths. Ninety-nine women suffered severe maternal outcome (SMO): 86 maternal near misses and 13 deaths. This adds up to a maternal near miss ratio of 21.5 per 1000 live births (95 % CI 17.3-26.5), a maternal mortality ratio of 325 per 100 000 live births (95 % CI 181-543) and a mortality index of 13.1 % (95 % CI 7.3-21.9). Hemorrhage (n = 49, 57 %) and hypertensive disorders (n = 27, 31.4 %) were the commonest MNM conditions. Eclampsia (n = 4/13; 30.7 %) was the leading cause of maternal mortality, while sepsis/peritonitis following cesarean section (n = 2/6; 33.3 %) had the highest mortality index. Seventy-seven out of 99 SMO cases (77.9 %) were referred from other facilities with critical conditions and 28 out of 99 SMO cases (28.3 %) were admitted into the Intensive Care Unit. Several indicators such as administration of oxytocin, magnesium sulfate and antibiotics were found to be suboptimal. Conclusions: MNM is common at district level in Rwanda.

This nationwide study aimed to investigate the burden of comorbidities in patients with NFPA and to examine whether gender influences the outcome. Design: NFPA patients were identified and followed-up from National Registries in Sweden. It was a nationwide, population-based study. Method: Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for comorbidities with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Comorbidities were analysed in all patients, both patients with and without hypopituitarism. Results: Included in the analysis were 2795 patients (1502 men, 1293 women), diagnosed with NFPA between 1987 and 2011. Hypopituitarism was reported in 1500 patients (54%). Mean patient-years at risk per patient was 7 (range 0-25). Both men (SIR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.8-2.5; P < 0.001) and women (2.9, 2.4-3.6; P < 0.001) had a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) than the general population, with women having a higher incidence compared with men (P = 0.02). The incidence of myocardial infarction was increased in women (1.7, 1.3-2.1; P < 0.001), but not in men. Both men (1.3, 1.1-1.6; P = 0.006) and women (2.3; 1.9-2.8; P < 0.001) had an increased incidence of cerebral infarction, with women having a higher incidence than men (P < 0.001). The incidence of sepsis was increased for both genders. The incidence of fractures was increased in women (1.8, 1.5-1.8; P < 0.001), but not for men.

In BDV, chlorophyll-a concentrations ([Chl-a]) was 3 times higher than in RDB on average, which accounts for the differences in oyster growth between BDV and RDB. Differences in trophic conditions could also explain the differences in C/N ratios and δ13C values between sites partly due to higher investment in gametogenesis for the oysters in BDV than in RDB; these differences widened when lipid normalized δ13C values were used. Oysters clearly selected microalgae as the main food source, and especially phytoplankton. Gi (Gills), Mu (Muscle) and Re (remaining organs) clearly exhibited different isotopie enrichment levels, with δMu> δGi > δReregardless of C or N elements, culture sites and seasons. δ15N discrimination between organs was rather equivalent between sites.

Official statistics too is starting to pay attention to these unofficial data sources, to the aim of using them within the production processes. Despite the potentials of new data for statistical production, so far we can depict two main effects on official statistics, and especially on population censuses. First of all, there is the digitalization of data construction through both new instruments (e.g. web questionnaires) and new means of collection (e.g. tablets). Furthermore, the integration and the scaling-up of data archives is ongoing.

Cost-optimal HEN generally leads also to a substantial reduction in pollutant gases emissions. However, HEN synthesis approaches are based generally on the optimization of total annual costs (TAC) only. In that manner, this work aims to address environmental impacts (EI) more directly. The EI were converted into an objective function by using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. With two objective functions (EI and TAC), a multi-objective optimization (MOO) may be performed. A meta-heuristic approach is adapted to handle MOO in the formulation proposed. As expected, a conflictive behaviour was noticed. The approach proposed was able to yield Pareto fronts efficiently, providing good intermediate solutions that could be used by decision-makers in search of a trade-off HEN configuration which is able to present low costs and is also environmentally friendly. The results reported in the case study also demonstrate the method reliability with intermediate solutions that are much more environmentally friendly than the cost optimal configurations, presenting costs only marginally higher.","[""Decision makers"",""Heat exchanger network"",""HEN synthesis"",""Hybrid Meta-heuristic"",""Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)"",""Meta-heuristic approach"",""Objective functions"",""Substantial reduction""]",,10.3303/CET1761228,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030772803,,0

In many low and middle income countries, however, large proportions of sewage are still released untreated into receiving water bodies. In-depth knowledge of how such discharges of untreated urban waste influences the environmental resistome is largely lacking. Here, we highlight the impact of uncontrolled discharge of partially treated and/or untreated wastewater on the structure of bacterial communities and resistome of sediments collected from Mutha river flowing through Pune city in India. Using shotgun metagenomics, we found a wide array (n = 175) of horizontally transferable antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including carbapenemases such as NDM, VIM, KPC, OXA-48 and IMP types. The relative abundance of total ARGs was 30-fold higher in river sediments within the city compared to upstream sites. Forty four ARGs, including the tet(X) gene conferring resistance to tigecycline, OXA-58 and GES type carbapenemases, were significantly more abundant in city sediments, while two ARGs were more common at upstream sites. The recently identified mobile colistin resistance gene mcr-1 was detected only in one of the upstream samples, but not in city samples. In addition to ARGs, higher abundances of various mobile genetic elements were found in city samples, including integron-associated integrases and ISCR transposases, as well as some biocide/metal resistance genes. Virulence toxin genes as well as bacterial genera comprising many pathogens were more abundant here; the genus Acinetobacter, which is often associated with multidrug resistance and nosocomial infections, comprised up to 29% of the 16S rRNA reads, which to our best knowledge is unmatched in any other deeply sequenced metagenome. There was a strong correlation between the abundance of Acinetobacter and the OXA-58 carbapenemase gene. Our study shows that uncontrolled discharge of untreated urban waste can contribute to an overall increase of the abundance and diversity of ARGs in the environment, including those conferring resistance to last-resort antibiotics.","[""Acinetobacters"",""Antibiotic resistance"",""Carbapenemase"",""India"",""mcr-1"",""River sediments"",""Anti-Bacterial Agents"",""Cities"",""Cross Infection"",""Drug Resistance, Microbial"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Genes, Bacterial"",""Geologic Sediments"",""India"",""Rivers"",""RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"",""Water Supply""]","[""Acinetobacter"",""Antibiotic resistance"",""Carbapenemase"",""India"",""mcr-1"",""NDM"",""River sediments""]",10.1016/j.watres.2017.07.060,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85026733733,,0

Claims to the resources of this sanctuary are politicised through the creation of a particularly damaging narrative by influential Odiya environmental actors about Bengalis, as illegal immigrants who have hurt the ecosystem through their fishing practices. Anchored within a theoretical framework of justice as recognition, the paper considers the making of a regional Odiya environmentalism that is, potentially, deeply exclusionary. It details how an argument about ‘illegal Bengalis’ depriving ‘indigenous Odiyas’ of their legitimate ‘traditional fishing rights’ derives from particular notions of indigeneity and territory. But the paper also shows that such environmentalism is tenuous, and fits uneasily with the everyday social landscape of fishing in coastal Odisha.

All rights reserved.The value of an ecological indicator is no better than the uncertainty associated with its estimate. Nevertheless, indicator uncertainty is seldom estimated, even though legislative frameworks such as the European Water Framework Directive stress that the confidence of an assessment should be quantified. We introduce a general framework for quantifying uncertainties associated with indicators employed to assess ecological status in waterbodies. The framework is illustrated with two examples: eelgrass shoot density and chlorophyll a in coastal ecosystems. Aquatic monitoring data vary over time and space; variations that can only partially be described using fixed parameters, and remaining variations are deemed random. These spatial and temporal variations can be partitioned into uncertainty components operating at different scales. Furthermore, different methods of sampling and analysis as well as people involved in the monitoring introduce additional uncertainty. We have outlined 18 different sources of variation that affect monitoring data to a varying degree and are relevant to consider when quantifying the uncertainty of an indicator calculated from monitoring data. However, in most cases it is not possible to estimate all relevant sources of uncertainty from monitoring data from a single ecosystem, and those uncertainty components that can be quantified will not be well determined due to the lack of replication at different levels of the random variations (e.g. number of stations, number of years, and number of people). For example, spatial variations cannot be determined from datasets with just one station. Therefore, we recommend that random variations are estimated from a larger dataset, by pooling observations from multiple ecosystems with similar characteristics. We also recommend accounting for predictable patterns in time and space using parametric approaches in order to reduce the magnitude of the unpredictable random components and reduce potential bias introduced by heterogeneous monitoring across time. We propose to use robust parameter estimates for both fixed and random variations, determined from a large pooled dataset and assumed common across the range of ecosystems, and estimate a limited subset of parameters from ecosystem-specific data. Partitioning the random variation onto multiple uncertainty components is important to obtain correct estimates of the ecological indicator variance, and the magnitude of the different components provide useful information for improving methods applied and design of monitoring programs. The proposed framework allows comparing different indicators based on their precision relative to the cost of monitoring.","[""European Water Framework Directive"",""Legislative frameworks"",""Marine strategy framework directives"",""Monitoring programs"",""Sources of uncertainty"",""Spatial and temporal variation"",""Status assessment"",""Water Framework Directives""]","[""Compliance probability"",""Indicator standardization"",""Marine Strategy Framework Directive"",""Monitoring programs"",""Status assessment"",""Water Framework Directive""]",10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.03.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961189991,https://zenodo.org/record/50744/files/ECOLIND-5882R1.pdf,0

This qualitative study is aimed at exploring the factors that influence adolescent girls' decision-making process in relation to contraceptive methods use and childbearing. Methods and Results: We collected qualitative data from study participants living in Rangpur district, Bangladesh. We conducted 35 in-depth interviews with married adolescent girls, 4 key informant interviews, and one focus group discussion with community health workers. Adolescent girls showed very low decision-making autonomy towards contraceptive methods use and child-bearing. Decisions were mainly made by either their husbands or mothers-in-law. When husbands were unemployed and financially dependent on their parents, then the mothers-in-law played most important role for contraceptive use and childbearing decisions. Lack of reproductive health knowledge, lack of negotiation and communication ability with husbands and family members, and mistrust towards contraceptive methods also appeared as influential factors against using contraception resulting in early childbearing among married adolescent girls. Conclusions: Husbands and mothers-in-law of newly married adolescent girls need to be actively involved in health interventions so that they make more informed decisions regarding contraceptive use to delay pregnancies until 20 years of age. Misunderstanding and distrust regarding contraceptives can be diminished by engaging the wider societal actors in health intervention including neighbours, and other family members.","[""Adolescent"",""Bangladesh"",""Child"",""Contraception"",""Decision Making"",""Educational Status"",""Family Characteristics"",""Female"",""Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"",""Humans"",""Marriage"",""Pregnancy"",""Pregnancy in Adolescence"",""Prospective Studies"",""Socioeconomic Factors"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0157664,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976589529,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157664&type=printable,0

This paper illustrates an alternative to the traditional supply chain of bread based on the principles of a circular economy. Methods: Six circular interactions among seven actors (grain farmers, bread producers, retailers, compostable packaging manufacturers, insect breeders, livestock farmers, consumers) of the circular filière are created in order to achieve the goal of ""zero waste"". In the model, two radical technological innovations are considered: insects used as animal feed and polylactic acid compostable packaging. Results: The main challenges for the implementation of the new supply chain are identified. Finally, some recent patents related to bread sustainable production, investigated in the current paper, are considered. Conclusion: Recommendations are given to academics and practitioners interested in the bio-based circular economy model approach for transforming agri-food supply chains.","[""Agriculture"",""Animals"",""Conservation of Natural Resources"",""Consumer Behavior"",""Food Supply"",""Humans"",""Livestock"",""Models, Economic"",""Uncertainty""]","[""Bread"",""Food waste"",""Insects as feed"",""Recycling"",""Reuse"",""Zero waste""]",10.2174/221279840801160304143939,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962248750,,0

As a consequence, marine fish are expected to undergo conditions outside of their tolerance range, leading to physiological challenges with possible detrimental implications. Our research group has previously shown that exposure to elevated CO2 modulated the immune system of the Atlantic halibut. To further investigate this finding, we analysed non-specific immune components in blood plasma of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) juveniles acclimated to six different temperatures (5, 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 °C), and to water pH of 8.0 (control) or 7.6 (predicted for year 2100) for three months. Plasma ions (K+, Na+, Ca++, Cl−) and lactate concentrations were also measured. The analysis of plasma ions did not show any trends related to temperature or CO2 exposure, and the majority of the experimental fish were able to maintain ionic balance. The results show that both innate immune components (lysozyme and alternative complement system) had increased activities in response to elevated CO2, representing a CO2-related impact on the halibut's immune system. The increased activity of lysozyme and complement system is possibly part of the acclimatization process, and might be protective.","[""Atlantic halibuts"",""Complement systems"",""Hippoglossus hippoglossus"",""Innate immunity"",""Lactate"",""Ocean acidifications"",""Plasma ions"",""Animals"",""Carbon Dioxide"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Flounder"",""Muramidase"",""Seawater"",""Stress, Physiological"",""Temperature""]","[""Atlantic halibut"",""Carbon dioxide"",""Complement system"",""Hippoglossus hippoglossus"",""Innate immunity"",""Lactate"",""Lysozyme"",""Ocean acidification"",""Plasma ions"",""Temperature""]",10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.09.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84996560070,,0

In this context, electronic beamforming systems have lower cost than mechanical ones. Knowing the uses of directive antennas and power dividers in electronic beamforming systems, this work aims at the design, simulation and measurements of these components at 5.8 GHz. Measurements with Power Divider showed very good return and insertion losses at 5.8 GHz: S11 = -23.5 dB and S21 = -3.8 dB. A printed dipole antenna was then fabricated, presenting -14.6 dB of return losses and a 2.82 dBi gain. Later, a 2-antenna beamforming front-end was implemented, proving the beamforming capability with the proposed devices. It also presented S11 = -15.7 dB, and a high directive gain (10.3 dBi). Since this is still a preliminary work, the results presented are very promising.","[""Directive gains"",""Electronic-beam-forming"",""Power divider"",""Printed dipole antennas"",""Radiated power"",""Return loss"",""Simulations and measurements"",""Wilkinson power dividers""]","[""beamforming"",""dipole antenna"",""power divider""]",10.1109/INSCIT.2016.7598215,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995513640,,0

Sea oil pollution monitoring is a key environmental topic and the use of remotely sensed measurements is of special interest. Within this context, the SAR, due to its almost all-weather and all-day imaging capability at fine spatial resolution, is the most effective tool. The availability of a number of satellite missions equipped with high performance single- and multipolarization SARs, along with the understanding of the scattering mechanisms ruling the backscattering of oil-free and oiled sea surface, fostered a new paradigm (known as physical processing) that resulted in a set of very effective and robust methods that allow: (a) detecting oil slicks against the sea surface background; (b) distinguishing oil slicks from a broad class of look-alikes in an unsupervised way; (c) providing deeper information on the damping properties of the pollutant.

All rights reserved.Compared to terrestrial environments our knowledge of microorganisms inhabiting oceans, the largest ecosystem on Earth, is limited. Deep oceans contain bacteria that thrive at high pressure and low temperature. For them, as for all bacteria, the outer structures of the cell are the first point of contact with the environment, both sensing and being modified in response to it. The vast majority of studied cold- and pressure-loving bacteria are Gram-negative and so in this chapter, the adaptations of their cell envelope and flagella are presented. In deep-sea bacteria, the structure of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides is modified in order to maintain membrane fluidity and enable membrane-localised proteins to perform their functions. Many of the membrane proteins involved in nutrient acquisition, transport, respiration, sensing and signalling are also specifically adapted to function at high pressure and low temperature. The ability to move towards nutrients or away from hostile environment is extremely important for bacterial survival and yet very vulnerable to increased pressure. Deep-sea bacteria are capable of swimming even at 150 MPa, which suggests their motility systems are specifically adapted to high pressure. Moreover, some bacteria have been shown to produce a second type of flagella (lateral flagella) in response to high pressure or low temperature. The findings presented in this chapter are a result of many techniques and analyses applied to whole microbial communities, single species as well as particular genes and proteins. Investigation of the adaptations to high pressure and low temperature not only expands basic knowledge but also identifies targets that could have biotechnological and industrial application. Deep-sea bacteria could be used for production of biofuels, secondary metabolites of value for drug development, and various pressure and temperature adapted enzymes.",,,10.1007/978-3-319-51686-8_3,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034413987,,0

Additionally, linear accumulation of mercury (Hg) was observed in all studied tissues, whereas for Cd this was only observed in the liver. Total Hg concentration above the upper neurochemical threshold was found in the sub-adult and adult brains and methylmercury (MeHg) of 2.2. mg/kg was found in the brain of one individual. Inter-elemental analysis showed significant positive correlations of Hg with selenium (Se) and Cd with Se in all studied tissues. Furthermore, differences in the elemental concentrations in the liver and brain tissues were found between juvenile, sub-adult and adult groups. The highest concentrations of manganese, iron, zinc, Se, Hg and MeHg were noted in the livers, whereas Cd predominantly accumulated in the kidneys.

One-way, directional changes in both plant and animal associations are likely to be occurring as a result of changing climate. Current knowledge of long-term cycles in insect communities is scarce, and therefore it is difficult to assess whether the observed changes in insect communities are the first part of a long-term trend or parts of normal cycles. 2. In this study multivariate methods were used to describe the trends in ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) assemblages over an 18-year (1994-2011) period at two Scottish sites. In order to have a deeper insight into the underlying processes, both environmental factors and the species driving the detected changes were investigated. 3. In four out of the six sample transects, insect community compositions showed trends rather than fluctuating patterns. Hierarchical cluster analysis also revealed a clear separation, after accounting for sampling location and broad habitat, between early and later years of sampling. Decreasing annual maximum temperatures and increasing precipitation were identified as the main environmental drivers. Although increased rainfall was expected to be beneficial for hygrophilous species, in the transects in this study generalist species increased in dominance. 4. The increasing importance of generalists, in the communities studied here, underlines the vulnerability of the specialist species and urges greater effort in their conservation. Assemblage changes along different trajectories at the sites in the present study could only be tracked using multivariate methods; commonly used diversity indices proved to be unsatisfactory. Therefore, the exclusive use of simple diversity indices should be discouraged and multivariate methods should be preferred in environmental assessments and conservation planning.",,"[""Biodiversity loss"",""Climate change"",""Community ecology"",""Long-term monitoring"",""Multivariate methods"",""UK Environmental Change Network""]",10.1111/een.12288,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959499808,,0

For the Pacific island countries to reach these goals, however, they depend on donor funding. This paper therefore analyses energy-related aid to the South Pacific from 1990 through 2012, and specifically evaluates its development in three areas: energy technology, grid vs. off-grid solutions, and project components. Using data from the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development, I find a recent shift in donor thinking: donors have, over the past years, put greater emphasis on renewable energy, especially hydro and increasingly solar power. Donors have also invested more in off-grid solutions - often solar-powered. Finally, donors have begun to focus more on 'software', that is, capacity-building, training and policy-making. If Pacific island countries, together with the donors, continue on this path, they are well-positioned to reach their ambitious renewable energy goals - and to serve as an example for other countries, both developing and developed, islands and non-islands.","[""Aid/development assistance"",""Economic cooperation and development"",""Electrification"",""Energy technologies"",""Pacific islands"",""Renewable energies"",""Renewable energy potentials"",""Renewable energy technologies""]","[""Aid/development assistance"",""Electrification"",""Pacific island countries"",""Renewable energy""]",10.1016/j.rser.2015.12.156,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954286092,,0

A growing incidence of distal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas and increasing use of minimally invasive techniques have prompted interest in this procedure. The aim of this study was to assess short-term results of minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIE-IL). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed from June 2007 until September 2014, including patients that underwent MIE-IL for distal esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer in six different hospitals in the Netherlands and Spain. Data were collected with regard to operative techniques, pathology and postoperative complications. Results: In total, 282 patients underwent MIE-IL, of which 90.2 % received neoadjuvant therapy. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 43 patients (15.2 %), of whom 13 patients (4.6 %) had empyema, necessitating thoracotomy for decortication. With an aggressive treatment of complications, the 30-day and in-hospital mortality rate was 2.1 %. An R0-resection was obtained in 92.5 % of the patients. After neoadjuvant therapy, 20.1 % of patients had a complete response. Conclusions: Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy for distal esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas is an upcoming approach for reducing morbidity caused by laparotomy and thoracotomy. Anastomotic leakage rate is still high possibly due to technical diversity of anastomotic techniques, and a high percentage of patients treated by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. An aggressive approach to complications leads to a low mortality of 2.1 %. Further improvement and standardization in the anastomotic technique are needed in order to perform a safe intrathoracic anastomosis.","[""Adenocarcinoma"",""Anastomosis, Surgical"",""Anastomotic Leak"",""Cohort Studies"",""Esophageal Neoplasms"",""Esophagectomy"",""Esophagogastric Junction"",""Female"",""Hospital Mortality"",""Humans"",""Intraoperative Complications"",""Laparoscopy"",""Lymph Node Excision"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Neoadjuvant Therapy"",""Netherlands"",""Postoperative Complications"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Spain"",""Thoracoscopy""]","[""Esophageal cancer"",""Esophagectomy"",""Intrathoracic anastomosis"",""Ivor Lewis"",""Minimally invasive""]",10.1007/s00464-016-4938-2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964607473,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00464-016-4938-2.pdf,0

A wide range of dressings is available, including modern dressings with different kinds of biological activity. Microbial burden is believed to underlie delayed healing, but the exact role of microbiofilm in wound healing is uncertain. Before choosing a specific wound dressing, four main functions should be considered: (1) cleaning, (2) absorbing, (3) regulating or (4) the necessity of adding medication. There is no clear evidence to support the use of one dressing over another, as demonstrated by many Cochrane review studies. In addition, the prescriber should enquire about contact allergies that may also develop during wound treatment. It is shown that early intervention and early investment may reduce the cost of treatment. The choice of wound dressings should be guided by cost, ease of application and patient and physician preference and be part of the complete strategy. The role of the medical specialist is evident.

This clade comprises several groups that invaded the land realm independently and in different time periods, e.g., Ellobioidea, Systellomatophora, and Stylommatophora. Thus, mitochondrial genomes of panpulmonate gastropods are promising to screen for adaptive molecular signatures related to land invasions. Results: We obtained three complete mitochondrial genomes of terrestrial panpulmonates, i.e., the ellobiid Carychium tridentatum, and the stylommatophorans Arion rufus and Helicella itala. Our dataset consisted of 50 mitogenomes comprising almost all major panpulmonate lineages. The phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial genes supports the monophyly of the clade Panpulmonata. Terrestrial lineages were sampled from Ellobioidea (1 sp.) and Stylommatophora (9 spp.). The branch-site test of positive selection detected significant non-synonymous changes in the terrestrial branches leading to Carychium (Ellobiodea) and Stylommatophora. These convergent changes occurred in the cob and nad5 genes (OXPHOS complex III and I, respectively). Conclusions: The convergence of the non-synonymous changes in cob and nad5 suggest possible ancient episodes of positive selection related to adaptations to non-marine habitats. The positively selected sites in our data are in agreement with previous results in vertebrates suggesting a general pattern of adaptation to the new metabolic requirements. The demand for energy due to the colonization of land (for example, to move and sustain the body mass in the new habitat) and the necessity to tolerate new conditions of abiotic stress may have changed the physiological constraints in the early terrestrial panpulmonates and triggered adaptations at the mitochondrial level.","[""Adaptation, Biological"",""Animals"",""Biological Evolution"",""Ecosystem"",""Gastropoda"",""Genome, Mitochondrial"",""Phylogeny""]","[""Codon models"",""Land invasion"",""Mitogenomics"",""Panpulmonata"",""Positive selection""]",10.1186/s12862-016-0735-8,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983314207,https://bmcevolbiol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12862-016-0735-8,0

Along with this, the fields of visibility of evaluative objects, meanings and understandings (Dean, M., 2010. Governmentality. Power and rule in modern societies. 2nd ed. London: Sage) are re-framed consistently with what Clarke, J. (2004. Changing welfare, changing states. New direction in social policy. London: Sage) terms a ‘performance/evaluation nexus’ that links effort, values, purposes and self-understanding to measures and comparisons of outputs (Ball, S.J., 2012. Performativity, commodification and commitment: an I-Spy guide to the neoliberal university. British journal of educational studies, 601, 17–28). In this paper, we focus on the field of higher education (HE), where numbers, in the form of performance indicators, benchmarks and headline targets, are frequently used to strategically orient the sector towards the objectives and goals of the Bologna Process and of the overall Europe 2020 agenda (Waldow, F., 2014. From taylor to tyler to no child left behind: legitimating educational standards. Prospects, 45 (1), 49–62). We aim to offer a comparative overview of the complex spectrum of metrics, provided at the supranational level, within the field of higher education by focusing on the European Research Area (ERA) in order to map and analyse some of the crucial issues in play. A second ambition of this paper is to move from a mapping and analytical perspective to a deconstruction of a specific subset of research metrics, with the aim of challenging the ‘self-evident truths’ and the dominant conventional wisdom that define current European metrics in order to bring into question whether they contribute to restructuring the universities’ research environments, affecting research policies and procedures.

Nonsurgical management through external immobilization is occasionally preferred to surgical management but is criticized for its higher rates of failure and lower patient satisfaction. Our aim is to analyze patient-reported outcomes in patients who underwent nonsurgical treatment for type II odontoid fractures. Methods: We identified patients >18-year-old who underwent external immobilization as a treatment for isolated type II odontoid fracture between 2007 and 2012. We collected demographic parameters, clinical presentation, mode of injury, imaging studies and modality and duration of treatment (soft collar, halo-vest, or both). Patients were contacted by telephone to participate in a 15-min survey addressing their recovery including their subjective rate of return to preinjury level of functioning. Results: Fifteen patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and participated in our survey. Patients were followed up for an average of 19 months after injury. Overall mean age was 61 years. Injury followed a mechanical fall or a road traffic accident in 11 and 4 cases, respectively. External immobilization was achieved by halo vest only in nine patients, soft collar only in two patients (13%), and through a sequential combination in the remaining 4 (27%). This was deployed for a mean of 7.8 months. Radiological studies at the last follow-up showed bony healing (27%), fibrous nonunion (60%), and persistent instability (13%). Patients reported gradual recovery of function throughout the 1st year after injury with levels above 70% of preinjury functioning achieved by 13% of patients at 6 months, 33% at 9 months, and 47% at 12 months. Overall satisfaction with nonsurgical management was 68%.

This currently impedes our ability to predict the responses of communities to the ongoing global changes in these major world’s biodiversity reservoirs. Here, we focus on the Sierra Nevada mountain range, a core region of the Baetic-Rifan biodiversity hotspot in the western Mediterranean, and explore the relative importance of soil properties and elevation in shaping phylogenetic and functional diversity of shrub communities. We recorded the total number of each species in community transects across elevation gradients and contrasting soil conditions, and measured some ecologically relevant functional traits (specific leaf area, leaf carbon:nitrogen ratio, plant height and blooming duration). Phylogenetic distances among species were inferred from a genus-level time-calibrated molecular phylogeny. Elevation was the main factor predicting phylogenetic and functional alpha diversity of plant communities. Species in high-elevation communities were phylogenetically distant but functionally similar, being relatively smaller and having relatively short blooming durations, whilst species in low-elevation communities showed the opposite pattern. Beta diversity in SLA and leaf C:N ratio based on species incidences were positively correlated with a soil pH and micronutrient gradient. Specifically, communities that develop on soils of high pH and low micronutrient concentrations showed low SLA values and high leaf C:N ratios, whilst communities on soils of lower pH and high micronutrient concentrations showed the opposite pattern. We conclude that soil properties and elevation simultaneously shape the structure of Mediterranean shrub communities by differentially acting on the different dimensions of the species niches. Elevation seems to filter plant height and phenology-related traits whereas nutrient-related functional traits are more related to soil properties. Our study illustrates the primary role of environmental heterogeneity for the maintenance of diversity in Mediterranean mountain ecosystems.",,"[""Alpha and beta diversity"",""Baetic-Rifan range"",""Community ecology"",""Environmental filtering"",""Functional diversity"",""Phylogenetic structure""]",10.1007/s10531-016-1113-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966309015,,0

Our aim was to evaluate the relative role of different drivers in shaping the diversity patterns of vertebrate herbivores, a group of organisms exerting a strong trophic influence in terrestrial Arctic ecosystems. This biome, traditionally perceived as homogeneous and low in biodiversity, includes wide variation in biotic and physical conditions and is currently undergoing major environmental change. Location: The Arctic (including the High Arctic, Low Arctic and Subarctic). Methods: We compiled available data on vertebrate (birds and mammals) herbivore distribution at a pan-Arctic scale, and used eight variables that represent the most relevant hypotheses for explaining patterns of species richness. We used range maps rasterized on a 100 km × 100 km equal-area grid to analyse richness patterns of all vertebrate herbivore species combined, and birds and mammalian herbivores separately. Results: Overall, patterns of herbivore species richness in the Arctic were positively related to plant productivity (measured using the normalized difference vegetation index) and to the species richness of predators. Greater species richness of herbivores was also linked to areas with a higher mean annual temperature. Species richness of avian and mammalian herbivores were related to the distance from the coast, with the highest avian richness in coastal areas and mammalian richness peaking further inland. Main conclusions: Herbivore richness in the Arctic is most strongly linked to primary productivity and the species richness of predators. Our results suggest that biotic interactions, with either higher or lower trophic levels or both, can drive patterns of species richness at a biome-wide scale. Rapid ongoing environmental changes in the Arctic are likely to affect herbivore diversity through impacts on both primary productivity and changes in predator communities via range expansion of predators from lower latitudes.",,"[""Biodiversity"",""biotic interactions"",""predator–prey"",""species richness"",""trophic interactions"",""tundra""]",10.1111/geb.12470,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971379044,https://opinvisindi.is/bitstream/20.500.11815/735/3/herbivore_diversity_FINAL.pdf,0

This study aims to assess the prognostic ability of the recently published SPAN-100 index in a large cohort of stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IV rtPA). Methods Using data from the prospective registery of all reperfusion treatments administered in Catalonia, we selected patients treated with IV rtPA alone between 2011 and 2012. The SPAN-100 index was calculated as the sum of age (years) and NIHSS score, and patients in the cohort were classified as SPAN-100 positive [≥ 100] or SPAN-100 negative [< 100]. We measured raw and adjusted rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH), mortality, and 3-month functional outcome (mRS 0-2) for each SPAN-100 category. Area under the ROC curve was calculated to predict the main outcome measures. Results We studied 1685 rtPA-treated patients, of whom 1405 (83%) were SPAN-100 negative. The SICH rates adjusted for sex, pre-stroke mRS, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, prior TIA/stroke and time to thrombolysis did not differ between groups, but likelihood of functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 3 months was nearly 8 times higher in the SPAN-100 negative group than in the positive group. Furthermore, the 3-month mortality rate was 5 times higher in the SPAN-100 positive group. ROC curve analysis showed high specificities for predicting both functional independence and 3-month mortality for a cut-off point of 100.

The study was designed as a case study of six Swedish urban secondary schools located in different demographic areas in southern Sweden. The study draws from individual interviews with school officials, focus group interviews with schools officials and observations from the schools’ student health team meetings. Contemporary research shows that there are several reasons why children and adolescents are neglected: parents’ mental illness, drug abuse, unemployment and living in poverty are some of the main factors explaining why children are neglected. The aim of this article is to explore school officials’ narratives about supporting students with different class backgrounds who are negatively affected by neglect and lack of parental care. The aim is also to explore schools’ collaborations with families, the social services and child and youth psychiatric care to support this group of students. Analytically the study takes its point of departure in how school officials read and position students and their families as classed subjects. Of interest is also to explore how the school professionals’ narratives connect to discourses on neglected children, social class and the schools’ responsibilities for handling these issues. The results indicate that students’ class background is central to the explanations given for social problems as well as to how different student groups are categorized. Discourses of family disorder and dysfunction are provided as the main explanations for neglect and lack of parental care among students growing up in child poverty, whereas discourses explaining middle-class students’ problems are related to young people’s loneliness and parents’ lack of time.",,"[""Class"",""Family"",""Neglect"",""Secondary school"",""Students"",""Urban""]",10.1007/s11256-016-0364-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968542087,,0

Here, we address tree species density in a fragmented Atlantic forest landscape to test the hypothesis that tree assemblages inhabiting edge-dominated forest habitats approach typical conditions of early successional systems. Seedlings and adults from 141 tree species were sampled across 39 0.1-ha plots: 19 in small fragments (<100 ha) and 20 in mature forest stands within the interior of the largest forest remnant of the study landscape (3500 ha). A total of 5448 seedlings and adults were recorded, with >55 % of all tree species exhibiting higher densities in small fragments than in mature forest, particularly pioneers (>60 % of all species). Seedlings and adults of these proliferating species differed from species exhibiting population declines in terms of wood density and seed size, respectively. Additionally, pioneers were more abundant than shade-tolerant species, as were hardwood species in the case of seedlings. Tree species showing highest population increases consisted largely of long-lived, light-demanding canopy species bearing soft or hardwood and small-to-medium-sized seeds. Tree assemblage structure also differed in terms of forest habitats with small forest fragments supporting few rare species, whereas the most rapidly proliferating species were much more widespread and abundant in fragments. However, 60 % of all adult pioneer species recorded in small fragments were not recorded as seedlings in this habitat type, although both seedling and adult assemblages were dominated by pioneer species. Edge-dominated tree assemblages are likely to experience long-term shifts toward greater dominance of long-lived, pioneer canopy species.",,"[""Extinction debt"",""Forest fragmentation"",""Pioneer species"",""Population density"",""Seed size"",""Tree assemblages"",""Tropical forest"",""Wood density""]",10.1007/s11258-016-0638-1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979590746,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/60869/1/Accepted_manuscript.pdf,0

Smoking behaviour is influenced by many factors, including the role of women’s significant others (SOs) and support from health-care professionals (HPs). Objectives To enhance understanding of the barriers to, and facilitators of, smoking cessation and the feasibility and acceptability of interventions to reach and support pregnant women to stop smoking. Design Four parts: (1) a description of interventions in the UK for smoking cessation in pregnancy; (2) three systematic reviews (syntheses) of qualitative research of women’s, SOs’ and HPs’ views of smoking in pregnancy using meta-ethnography (interpretative approach for combining findings); (3) semistructured interviews with pregnant women, SOs and HPs, guided by the social-ecological framework (conceptualises behaviour as an outcome of individuals’ interactions with environment); and (4) identification of new/improved interventions for future testing. Setting Studies in reviews conducted in high-income countries. Qualitative research was conducted from October 2013 to December 2014 in two mixed urban/rural study sites: area A (Scotland) and area B (England). Participants Thirty-eight studies (1100 pregnant women) in 42 papers, nine studies (150 partners) in 14 papers and eight studies described in nine papers (190 HPs) included in reviews. Forty-one interviews with pregnant women, 32 interviews with pregnant women’s SOs and 28 individual/group interviews with 48 HPs were conducted. Main outcome measures The perceived barriers to, and facilitators of, smoking cessation in pregnancy and the identification of potential new/modified interventions. Results Syntheses identified smoking-related perceptions and experiences for pregnant women and SOs that were fluid and context dependent with the capacity to help or hinder smoking cessation. Themes were analysed in accordance with the social-ecological framework levels. From the analysis of the interviews, the themes that were central to cessation in pregnancy at an individual level, and that reflected the findings from the reviews, were perception of risk to baby, self-efficacy, influence of close relationships and smoking as a way of coping with stress. Overall, pregnant smokers were faced with more barriers than facilitators. At an interpersonal level, partners’ emotional and practical support, willingness to change smoking behaviour and role of smoking within relationships were important. Across the review and interviews of HPs, education to enhance knowledge and confidence in delivering information about smoking in pregnancy and the centrality of the client relationship, protection of which could be a factor in downplaying risks, were important. HPs acknowledged that they could best assist by providing support and understanding, and access to effective interventions, including an opt-out referral pathway to Stop Smoking Services, routine carbon monoxide screening, behavioural support and access to pharmacotherapy. Additional themes at community, organisational and societal levels were also identified. Limitations Limitations include a design grounded in qualitative studies, difficulties recruiting SOs, and local service configurations and recruitment processes that potentially skewed the sample.

Within this context, this paper presents a set of activities designed to make children aware of various marketing tactics, mainly related to advertising, so that they become empowered to make informed consumer choices. The design of the intervention and the evaluation of its effectiveness make a number of contributions to current research. Firstly, teachers carried out the activities, a role traditionally assigned to parents or researchers in previous literature. Secondly, we broaden the scope of indicators measuring the effectiveness of the activities by including the evaluation of changes not only in advertising literacy, but also in attitudes towards advertising and in children's behaviours. Results show the effectiveness of the intervention in preparing children to better deal with advertising.

This requires knowing which ES are perceived as important. We asked decision-makers from different thematic backgrounds to rank 25 ES on the basis of their importance for society. To test whether perceptions are varying across regions, we surveyed three Alpine regions in Austria and Italy. The ranking of importance showed a high variability amongst experts but was not influenced by region or thematic background. ES that satisfy physiological needs (‘fresh water’, ‘food’, ‘air quality regulation’) were indicated as most important. ES that relate to safety and security needs were ranked in the middle field, whereas cultural ES were perceived as less important. We used principal component analysis (PCA) to identify ES bundles based on perception of importance. In order to investigate whether research intensity follows the perceived importance, we related the interviews with a comprehensive literature review. ‘Global climate regulation’, ‘food’, ‘biodiversity’, ‘fresh water’ and ‘water quality’ were studied most often. Although ‘habitat’, ‘energy’, ‘primary production’, ‘tourism’, ‘water cycle’, and ‘local climate regulation’ were ranked as important by decision-makers, they did not receive corresponding research attention. We conclude that more interaction between research and stakeholders is needed to promote a broader application and understanding of the ES concept in practice.

A key aspect for obtaining ecologically and economically sustainable aquaculture in threatened coastal areas is the requirement of geographic information of growth and potential production capacity. Growth varies over time and space and depends on a complex pattern of interactions between the bivalve and a diverse range of environmental factors (e.g. temperature, salinity, food availability). Understanding these processes and modelling the environmental control of bivalve growth has been central in aquaculture. In contrast to the most conventional modelling techniques, quantile regression can handle cases where not all factors are measured and provide the possibility to estimate the effect at different levels of the response distribution and give therefore a more complete picture of the relationship between environmental factors and biological response. Observation of the relationships between environmental factors and growth of the bivalve Mytilus edulis revealed relationships that varied both among level of growth rate and within the range of environmental variables along the Swedish west coast. The strongest patterns were found for water oxygen concentration level which had a negative effect on growth for all oxygen levels and growth levels. However, these patterns coincided with differences in growth among periods and very little of the remaining variability within periods could be explained indicating that interactive processes masked the importance of the individual variables. By using quantile regression and local regression (LOESS) this study was able to provide valuable information on environmental factors influencing the growth of M. edulis and important insight for the development of ecosystem based management tools of aquaculture activities, its use in mitigation efforts and successful management of human use of coastal areas.",,"[""Growth"",""Modelling"",""Mytilus edulis"",""Quantile regression""]",10.1016/j.ecss.2016.01.040,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960392859,,0

Focusing on Beijing and Shanghai, this paper carries out a measures-based economic analysis of low carbon investment opportunities in the residential sector. Results find significant opportunity: between 2015 and 2030, BAU levels of CO2 emissions could be reduced by 10.2% in Beijing and 6.8% in Shanghai with the adoption of economically attractive low carbon measures.

A major challenge in administering timely treatment is determining whether the stroke is due to vascular blockage (ischaemic) or haemorrhage. For patients with ischaemic stroke, thrombolysis (i.e. pharmacological 'clot-busting') can improve outcomes when delivered swiftly after onset, and current National Health Service Quality Improvement Scotland guidelines are for thrombolytic therapy to be provided to at least 80 per cent of eligible patients within 60 min of arrival at hospital. Thrombolysis in haemorrhagic stroke could severely compound the brain damage, so administration of thrombolytic therapy currently requires near-immediate care in a hospital, rapid consultation with a physician and access to imaging services (X-ray computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) and intensive care services. This is near impossible in remote and rural areas, and stroke mortality rates in Scotland are 50 per cent higher than in London. We here describe our current project developing a technology demonstrator with ultrasound imaging linked to an intelligent, multi-channel communication device - connecting to multiple 2G/3G/4G networks and/or satellites - in order to stream live ultrasound images, video and two-way audio streams to hospital-based specialists who can guide and advise ambulance clinicians regarding diagnosis. With portable ultrasound machines located in ambulances or general practices, use of such technology is not confined to stroke, although this is our current focus. Ultrasound assessment is useful in many other immediate care situations, suggesting potential wider applicability for this remote support system. Although our research programme is driven by rural need, the ideas are potentially applicable to urban areas where access to imaging and definitive treatment can be restricted by a range of operational factors.","[""Ambulances"",""Communication"",""Emergency Medical Services"",""Hospitals"",""Humans"",""Internet"",""Stroke"",""Telemedicine"",""Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial"",""United Kingdom""]","[""acute stroke emergency treatment"",""medical data and image transfer in remote locations"",""technology-supported diagnosis""]",10.1177/1460458215580353,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84981347271,https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/55118/1/Mort_etal_HIJ_2015_Combining_transcranial_ultrasound_with_intelligent_communication_methods_to_enhance_the_remote_assessment_and_management_of_stroke.pdf,0

Here we investigate Upper Jurassic sediments from the Josephine Ridge region of the Central Graben, North Sea, by integrating geophysical, palynological, petrophysical and sedimentological datasets to analyse the palaeoenvironments of the Jade and Judy horsts, the tops of which are not preserved. Interpretation of geophysical and petrophysical data together with core descriptions shows study wells to step progressively away from the Josephine Ridge into adjacent grabens. One hundred and five palynological samples from six wells range from the Oxfordian to the Lower Tithonian, spanning the syn-rift period of the Central Graben. Samples from the adjacent grabens and the Jade Horst are rich in dinoflagellate cysts and possess < 20% terrestrial palynomorphs. Samples from the Judy Horst contain a wide range of terrestrial palynomorphs, dominated by lycopsid, fern and moss spores, representing c.50% of the recovered palynomorphs. Correspondence analysis of the assemblages implies that Jade did not possess a terrestrial ecosystem; Judy samples define seven groupings of related miospores, all interpreted to represent very low lying, relatively early successional type environments. This implies subaerial exposure of the Judy Horst during the Late Jurassic, which is interpreted to have formed an isolated, low relief, footwall crest island. This study provides a new methodology for investigating rift topography, particularly in cases where the tops of horsts were subsequently removed by erosion.

Existing combined regulatory and voluntary approaches applied in the UK continue to fail to deliver the necessary environmental outcomes for a variety of reasons including failure to achieve high adoption rates. It is therefore logical to identify specific on-farm mitigation measures towards which farmers express positive attitudes for higher future uptake rates. Accordingly, a farmer attitudinal survey was undertaken during phase one of the Demonstration Test Catchment programme in England to understand those measures towards which surveyed farmers are most receptive to increasing implementation in the future. A total of 29 on-farm measures were shortlisted by this baseline farm survey. This shortlist comprised many low cost or cost-neutral measures suggesting that costs continue to represent a principal selection criterion for many farmers. The 29 measures were mapped onto relevant major farm types and input, assuming 95% uptake, to a national scale multi-pollutant modelling framework to predict the technically feasible impact on annual agricultural emissions to water and air, relative to business as usual. Simulated median emission reductions, relative to current practise, for water management catchments across England and Wales, were estimated to be in the order sediment (20%)>ammonia (16%)>total phosphorus (15%)>nitrate/methane (11%)>nitrous oxide (7%). The corresponding median annual total cost of the modelled scenario to farmers was £3 ha-1yr-1, with a corresponding range of -£84ha-1yr-1 (i.e. a net saving) to £33ha-1yr-1. The results suggest that those mitigation measures which surveyed farmers are most inclined to implement in the future would improve the environmental performance of agriculture in England and Wales at minimum to low cost per hectare.","[""Agricultural emissions"",""Agricultural pollution"",""Environmental outcome"",""Environmental performance"",""Farmer attitudes"",""Mitigation"",""Principal selections"",""Uncertainty"",""Agriculture"",""Air Pollutants"",""England"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Environmental Pollution"",""Farmers"",""Nitrates"",""Phosphorus"",""Water Pollutants""]","[""Agricultural pollution"",""Farmer attitudes"",""Mitigation"",""Multi-pollutant modelling"",""Uncertainty""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.130,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84953931803,https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/ws/files/74586575/ALC_DTC_farmer_attitudes_FS_10_R1_.pdf,0

Heterogeneous landscapes are capable of providing multiple ESs, and landscape configuration—spatial arrangement of land cover in the landscape—is expected to affect ES capacity. However, the majority of ES mapping studies have not accounted for landscape configuration. Objectives: Our objective is to assess and quantify the relevance of configuration for mapping ES capacity. A review of empirical evidence for configuration effects on the capacity of ten ESs reveals that for four ESs configuration is relevant but typically ignored in ES quantification. For four ESs we quantify the relevance of configuration for mapping ESs using Scotland as a case study. Methods: Each ES was quantified through modelling, respectively ignoring or accounting for configuration. The difference in ES capacity between the two ES models was determined at multiple spatial scales. Results: Configuration affected the capacity of all four ESs mapped, particularly at the cell and watershed scale. At the scale of Scotland most local effects averaged out. Flood control and sediment retention responded strongest to configuration. ESs were affected by different aspects of configuration, thus requiring specific methods for mapping each ES. Conclusions: Accounting for configuration is important for the assessment of certain ESs at the cell and watershed scale. Incorporating configuration in landscape management provides opportunities for spatial optimization of ES capacity, but the diverging response of ESs to configuration suggests that accounting for configuration involves trade-offs between ESs.",,"[""InVEST"",""Land use Land cover"",""Landscape heterogeneity"",""Landscape structure"",""Multifunctional landscapes"",""Trade-off""]",10.1007/s10980-016-0345-2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959080823,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10980-016-0345-2.pdf,0

A pot experiment was performed with sludges produced in a pilot wastewater treatment plant containing realistic Ag concentrations (18 and 400 mg kg-1, 14 mg kg-1 for the control). Investigations focused on the highest dose treatment. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) showed that Ag2S was the main species in the sludge and amended soil before and after plant culture. The second most abundant species was an organic and/or amorphous Ag - S phase whose proportion slightly varied (from 24% to 36%) depending on the conditions. Micro and nano X-ray fluorescence (XRF) showed that Ag was preferentially associated with S-rich particles, including organic fragments, of the sludge and amended soils. Ag was distributed as heteroaggregates with soil components (size ranging from ≤0.5 to 1-3 μm) and as diffused zones likely corresponding to sorbed/complexed Ag species. Nano-XRF evidenced the presence of mixed metallic sulfides. Ag was weakly exchangeable and labile. However, micronutrient mobilization by plant roots and organic matter turnover may induce Ag species interconversion eventually leading to Ag release on longer time scales.

The present study aimed to identify and characterize the production of AHLs by Paracoccus sp. Ss63, which was isolated from the Mediterranean sponge Sarcotragus sp. High performance liquid chromatography - high resolution tandem mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS/MS) provided evidence for the production, by Paracoccus sp. Ss63, of twelve saturated long-chain AHLs (3-OH-C10-HSL, 3-OH-C12-HSL, C10-HSL, 3-OH-C14-HSL, C12-HSL, 3-O-C16-HSL, 3-OH-C16-HSL, C14-HSL, 3-OH-C18-HSL, C16-HSL, 3-O-C18-HSL, and C18-HSL), along with four putative unsaturated long-chain AHLs (C10: 1-HSL, 3-OH-C18: 1-HSL, C16: 1-HSL, and C18: 1-HSL). The distribution of Paracoccus sp. Ss63 in different sponge species, as well as in seawater and marine sediment samples, suggests a mixed lifestyle for this bacterium, i.e.; free-living and host-associated. The high pH of seawater is likely to inactivate the AHL signal molecules, and limit the possibility of AHLs to accumulate to the concentration required for QS-based gene regulation. We hypothesize that Paracoccus sp. Ss63 utilizes quorum sensing to sense and respond to the different environments it experiences, with an active QS only when found inside enclosed niches (host-associated and at lower pH).",,"[""free-living"",""host-associated"",""isolation"",""lactones"",""marine sponges"",""quorum sensing"",""Sarcotragus""]",10.1002/ijch.201600003,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963642790,,0

Significant proportions of up to 30-50% of natural Pb, derived from mineral dust, are observed in Atlantic surface waters, reflecting the success of the global effort to reduce anthropogenic Pb emissions. The observation of mineral dust derived Pb in surface waters is governed by the elevated atmospheric mineral dust concentration of the North African dust plume and the dominance of dry deposition for the atmospheric aerosol flux to surface waters.

These food webs do not necessarily include critical pathways by which ecosystems interact with ocean biogeochemistry and climate. Here we present a global biogeochemical model which incorporates ecosystem dynamics based on the representation of ten plankton functional types (PFTs): six types of phytoplankton, three types of zooplankton, and heterotrophic procaryotes. We improved the representation of zooplankton dynamics in our model through (a) the explicit inclusion of large, slow-growing macrozooplankton (e.g. krill), and (b) the introduction of trophic cascades among the three zooplankton types. We use the model to quantitatively assess the relative roles of iron vs. grazing in determining phytoplankton biomass in the Southern Ocean high-nutrient low-chlorophyll (HNLC) region during summer. When model simulations do not include macrozooplankton grazing explicitly, they systematically overestimate Southern Ocean chlorophyll biomass during the summer, even when there is no iron deposition from dust. When model simulations include a slow-growing macrozooplankton and trophic cascades among three zooplankton types, the high-chlorophyll summer bias in the Southern Ocean HNLC region largely disappears. Our model results suggest that the observed low phytoplankton biomass in the Southern Ocean during summer is primarily explained by the dynamics of the Southern Ocean zooplankton community, despite iron limitation of phytoplankton community growth rates. This result has implications for the representation of global biogeochemical cycles in models as zooplankton faecal pellets sink rapidly and partly control the carbon export to the intermediate and deep ocean.",,,10.5194/bg-13-4111-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978986520,https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/4111/2016/bg-13-4111-2016.pdf,0

Heterogeneity in within-family processes,"© 2016 American Psychological Association.This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the normative declines in adolescent disclosure and maternal knowledge over the course of adolescence, by assessing the underlying monitoring processes. Multilevel structural equation models were applied to 15 assessments among 479 families across 5 years (13 years at T1, 57% boys, 11% low socioeconomic status). Developmental declines in mother-perceived disclosure and knowledge were observed, which were partially explained by processes operating at the level of the family unit. On average, mothers were more knowledgeable in weeks with more disclosure and more solicitation, and adolescent disclosure was higher in weeks with more maternal solicitation and less control. The effect sizes and even the directions of these within-family correlations varied between families, however. This heterogeneity was partially explained by the level of maternal control and adolescent disclosure, and by the families' socioeconomic status. Within-family fluctuations in knowledge and disclosure were also correlated with fluctuations in relationship quality and adolescent and mother mood. Overall, these within-family processes explained up to 14% of the normative developmental decline in disclosure and 19% of the decline in knowledge. This study thus suggests that a wide variety in monitoring processes may drive normative declines in adolescent disclosure and maternal knowledge.","[""Adolescent"",""Adolescent Development"",""Disclosure"",""Family"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Male"",""Models, Psychological"",""Mother-Child Relations"",""Mothers"",""Psychology, Adolescent""]","[""Adolescent disclosure"",""Heterogeneity"",""Longitudinal"",""Parental monitoring"",""Within-person""]",10.1037/dev0000220,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85000624242,https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/2ee73c83-a9dd-4cd5-8056-1f6152fa33bf,0

The spread of invasive species poses a particular environmental threat on the islands of the Mediterranean Basin, which are hot spots of biodiversity and contain rare habitats and endemic species, especially on small islands, which are highly vulnerable to biodiversity loss. Following a recent survey, in this paper we aim to provide an overview of the present-day non-native vascular flora of small Mediterranean islands based on a sample of 37 islands located in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, off the coast of Italy. By comparing the current data with those gathered during a previous survey conducted in the same study area, we also aim to highlight the main changes that have occurred in non-native plant species diversity, establishment and distribution in recent years and to present a first general overview of the most prominent plant taxa in the island’s introduced flora, focusing on those most responsible for these changes and those that pose the greatest environmental threats. We recorded 203 non-native plant species, 147 of which have established on at least one of the islands investigated. Overall, we detected a sharp increase in the number of species, in their levels of establishment and in the extent of their distribution within the study area in recent years. This may be explained by the intensification of research on plant invasions, as well as to new introduction, escape, establishment and invasion events on the islands in recent decades. The most remarkable plants detected include acacias and succulents, two groups that appear to be emerging very rapidly and to be posing new threats to the conservation of the islands’ natural environment, especially the genus Carpobrotus, whose spread into natural habitats containing rare and endemic taxa is seriously threatening biodiversity on both a local and global scale. On the whole, our results show that the plant invasion phenomenon in the study area has in recent years intensified considerably. As this process seems likely to continue, we should expect more establishment events in the future and the further spread of species that are already present. This is of particular conservation concern on the islands investigated in this survey, which are rich in endemisms, but have been facing deep socio-economic and environmental transformations in these last decades as a consequence of the abandonment of traditional management practices and the development of tourism. Our study thus confirms that plant invasions on Mediterranean islands are a serious environmental problem that threatens biodiversity conservation not only in the Mediterranean biogeographic region, but also on the global scale, and highlights the need to further increase efforts aimed at preventing, controlling or mitigating the effects of plant invasions in island ecosystems.",,"[""Acacia"",""biological invasions"",""Cactaceae"",""Carpobrotus"",""eradication"",""established alien species"",""Italy"",""nature conservation"",""succulence"",""threats to global biodiversity""]",10.1080/11263504.2016.1218974,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988965840,,0

Methods: 22,226 young persons in Iceland anonymously completed self-report questionnaires screening for conduct disorder and ADHD. In addition, they stated whether they had a diagnosis of ADHD and had received ADHD medication, and their history of offending, police interrogation and false confession. Participants were stratified into two age groups, 14–16 and 17–24 years. Results: The older group was significantly more likely to have been interrogated by the police but the younger group were much more vulnerable to false confession during interrogation. Males were more likely to be at risk for both than females. The severity of the ADHD condition increased the risk of both interrogation and false confession. Negative binomial regressions showed that age, gender, conduct disorder, offending, and ADHD symptoms were all significant predictors of both interrogations and number of false confessions. Conduct disorder was the single best predictor of police interrogation, but the findings were more mixed regarding false confessions. Young people presenting with a combination of severe ADHD and comorbid conduct disorder had the worst outcome for both interrogation and false confessions. Conclusions: The findings endorse the need for support of persons with ADHD to be put in place to ensure fair due process and to prevent miscarriages of justice.","[""Adolescent"",""Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity"",""Coercion"",""Comorbidity"",""Conduct Disorder"",""Epidemiologic Studies"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Iceland"",""Juvenile Delinquency"",""Male"",""Police"",""Risk Factors"",""Severity of Illness Index"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Truth Disclosure"",""Young Adult""]","[""ADHD"",""Conduct disorder"",""Epidemiology"",""False confessions"",""Interrogation"",""Offending""]",10.1007/s00127-015-1145-8,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946125551,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00127-015-1145-8.pdf,0

Anox Kaldness-K1 carriers were used as biofilm carrier material. The reactor performance and biofilm formation were evaluated during the process. The start-up process at lower liquid recirculation flow rate enhanced the biofilm formation and reactor performance. The organic substrate composition had a major impact on early colonization of methanogenic archaea onto the surface of the Kaldness carriers during the start-up process. Specific organic substrates favouring the growth of methanogenic archaea, such as acetate, are preferred in order to facilitate the subsequent biofilm formation and AFBR start-up. The supply of ‘bio-available’ nutrients and trace elements, in particular iron, had an important role on optimal methanogenic activity and speeding-up of the biofilm development on the Kaldness carriers.

All rights reserved.This paper investigates the removal of direct dyes through adsorption on chitin-containing residues. As representative waste, the shells of two shrimp species are tested. Removal percentage up to 90% for the tested dyes are obtained in about 2 h, using 2.1 mg mL-1 of shells, simply dried and grinded. Comparative analyses are also conducted on commercial chitin and chitosan flakes. Kinetic tests are carried out in batch and at lab scale. Data are modeled through the pseudo second-order kinetic law, and a value of modeling efficiency close to 1 is obtained. Adsorption isotherms are traced with the temperature varying between 10 °C and 50 °C. The results are first analyzed using the Langmuir expression, and then interpreted following a statistical physics approach to obtain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon at the molecular level. The anchorage number, the steric hinderance coefficient, and the half saturation coefficient are derived. All experimental data indicate a monolayer adsorption process that is limited to the existing micro-porosity, favored by concentration gradient diffusion, and characterized by several anchorage points for each single molecule.","[""Comparative analysis"",""Concentration gradients"",""Direct dyes"",""Monolayer adsorption"",""Pseudo second order kinetics"",""Shrimp shells"",""Statistical approach"",""Statistical physics""]","[""Adsorption"",""Chitin"",""Chitosan"",""Direct dyes"",""Shrimp shells"",""Statistical approach""]",10.1016/j.jece.2016.08.028,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84986887494,,0

Background: In the final stage of dementia disease, the persons are often cared for at nursing homes and they often die there. The research concurs that a palliative approach to end-of-life care is essential but there are still some limitations regarding research about what constitutes the end-of-life care provided to persons affected by dementia in Sweden. Design: Descriptive qualitative method with a retrospective approach. Method: Nursing records (n = 50) and medical records (n = 50) were retrospectively reviewed in two nursing homes. The analysis was conducted using deductive and inductive content analysis. Three phases of The Liverpool Care Pathway; Initial assessment, Continuous assessment and Follow-up, were used deductively to first sort the text in the records, then the text in each phase was further analysed with inductive content analysis. Four categories and 11 subcategories described the content in the records. Results: The end-of-life care was described in the healthcare records based on such categories as decision-making, participation and communication, assessment and prevention of symptom and following up after the residents had died. Conclusion: Paticularly, physical symptoms were documented and, to a lesser degree, psychological or existential/spiritual needs. Relevance to clinical practice: Healthcare professionals must have a holistic view of the person affected by dementia during the end-of-life care and, according to this study, more focus must be placed on their psychosocial and existential needs in the documentation of end-of-life care.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Communication"",""Decision Making"",""Dementia"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Nursing Homes"",""Nursing Records"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Sweden"",""Terminal Care""]","[""Dementia"",""Documentation"",""End of life"",""Palliative care"",""Patient records""]",10.1111/jocn.13184,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964777712,,0

Pubilshed by Taylor & Francis.As developing countries around the world formulate policies to address climate change, concerns remain as to whether the voices of those most exposed to climate risk are represented in those policies. Developing countries face significant challenges for contextualizing global-scale scientific research into national political dynamics and downscaling global frameworks to sub-national levels, where the most affected are presumed to live. This article critiques the ways in which the politics of representation and climate science are framed and pursued in the process of climate policy development, and contributes to an understanding of the relative effectiveness of globally framed, generic policy mechanisms in vulnerable and politically volatile contexts. Based on this analysis, it also outlines opportunities for the possibility of improving climate policy processes to contest technocratic framing and generic international adaptation solutions. Policy relevance Nepal's position as one of the countries most at risk from climate change in the Himalayas has spurred significant international support to craft climate policy responses over the past few years. Focusing on the National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) and the Climate Change Policy, this article examines the extent to which internationally and scientifically framed climate policy in Nepal recognizes the unfolding political mobilizations around the demand for a representative state and equitable adaptation to climate risks. This is particularly important in Nepal, where political unrest in the post-conflict transition after the end of the civil war in 2006 has focused around struggles over representation for those historically on the political margins. Arguing that vulnerability to climate risk is produced in conjunction with social and political conditions, and that not everyone in the same locality is equally vulnerable, we demonstrate the multi-faceted nature of the politics of representation for climate policy making in Nepal. However, so far, this policy making has primarily been shaped through a technocratic framing that avoids political contestations and downplays the demand for inclusive and deliberative processes. Based on this analysis, we identify the need for a flexible, contextually grounded, and multi-scalar approach to political representation while also emphasizing the need for downscaling climate science that can inform policy development and implementation to achieve fair and effective adaptation to climate change.",,"[""adaptation"",""National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA)"",""Nepal"",""public policy"",""representation""]",10.1080/14693062.2014.1003775,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84923290842,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/14693062.2014.1003775?needAccess=true,0

Drawing on Michel Foucault's discussion on the shift from sovereignty to governmentality and the rise of biopolitics, it is argued that the academic critique of censorship has to take its productive aspects more into account. A close examination of two cases of censorship-regarding the short story ""Dudh ka Dam"" by Premchand and the film Haider by Vishal Bhardwaj- illustrates the importance of questions of territoriality as well as the significance of dispersed forms of power for the biopolitical project. The politics of hurt sentiments, thus, become discernible as a powerful tool for the production and organisation of discursive, and at times even physical, forms of violence that are aimed at eradicating the roots for potential threats to the alleged unity of the nation and its population. For this, equating criticism, or deviant behaviour, with intentional assaults thus legitimises the restriction of speech by representing it as a necessary act of self-defence.",,,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994472211,,0

Yet, there has been little research on photosynthetic and metabolic traits, which sustain the high productivity of A. donax under drought conditions. This study determined phenotypic differences between two A. donax ecotypes coming from stands with contrasting adaptation to dry climate. We hypothesized that the Bulgarian (BG) ecotype, adapted to drier conditions, exhibits greater drought tolerance than the Italian (IT) ecotype, adapted to a more mesic environment. Under well-watered conditions the BG ecotype was characterized by higher photosynthesis, mesophyll conductance, intrinsic water use efficiency, PSII efficiency, isoprene emission rate and carotenoids, whereas the IT ecotype showed higher levels of hydroxycinnamates. Photosynthesis of water-stressed plants was mainly limited by diffusional resistance to CO2 in BG, and by biochemistry in IT. Recovery of photosynthesis was more rapid and complete in BG than in IT, which may indicate better stability of the photosynthetic apparatus associated to enhanced induction of volatile and non-volatile isoprenoids and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis. This study shows that a large phenotypic plasticity among A. donax ecotypes exists, and may be exploited to compensate for the low genetic variability of this species when selecting plant productivity in constrained environments.","[""Adaptation, Biological"",""Bulgaria"",""Butadienes"",""Carotenoids"",""Droughts"",""Ecotype"",""Hemiterpenes"",""Italy"",""Pentanes"",""Phenotype"",""Photosynthesis"",""Poaceae""]","[""Arundo donax"",""Calvin cycle"",""Drought stress"",""Ecotype"",""Isoprene"",""Phenylpropanoids"",""Photosynthesis""]",10.1093/jxb/erx125,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85022059529,https://academic.oup.com/jxb/article-pdf/68/9/2439/17634255/erx125.pdf,0

Published by Elsevier B.V.Compared to cars motorcycles are potentially the more sustainable means of transport. Motorcycles need less space, consume fewer resources, and pollute less than cars with typically low occupancy. Thus, can the promotion of motorcycles potentially improve the sustainability of urban transport systems within an Asian context? The objective of this study is to investigate how pursuing this idea might impact urban transport systems beyond its apparent and immediate benefits by considering the wider consequences over an extended period of time. Chiang Mai, a medium-sized regional city in Thailand was chosen for the case study. The analysis carried out highlights the unique features of trips made by motorcycle and quantifies the effects of policies that promote motorcycle ownership and use. The result of the study is that despite its apparent benefits, promotion of motorcycle even can worsen the sustainability of a transport system. However, implementation of certain mitigations, such as parking organisation, can improve the outcomes. The findings emphasize the need to consider a systemic perspective in implementing urban transport measures. The urban transport system is complex and can react to certain intervention in an unexpected manner that may conflict with intended goals.",,"[""Land use"",""Motorised-two wheeler"",""System approach"",""System Dynamics"",""Transport model""]",10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.365,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020164302,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.365,0

Versteegh 2017.Introduction The principal aim of this research project is to gain insight into the state of civil society in Europe from a legal perspective, and more specifically regarding countries with membership of the Council of Europe. The method used is firstly to compare the legislation pertaining to CSOs in a range of European countries and subsequently to analyse the findings in the light of normative principles derived from the freedom of association, other fundamental rights and freedoms and other principles pertaining to civil society organisations derived from various European-level sources. We include the existence of democracy and the rule of law as given circumstances. As was set out in Chapter 2, freedom of association and, especially for foundations and trusts, the freedom of expression and the right to property, provide a relevant and useful normative framework within which major aspects of civil society organisation (CSO) law and administrative practice can be tested. Other relevant sources of information are (draft) EU regulations and the more comprehensive Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)14 of the Committee of Ministers to member states of the Council of Europe on the legal status of non-governmental organisations in Europe, which was issued in 2007 (henceforth referred to as Recommendation CM/Rec(2007)14), and other documents published by the Council of Europe and the EU which express the importance of a flourishing civil society, which were discussed in further detail in Chapter 3. The overall picture that arises from European institutions such as the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR), the European Union (EU) and the Council of Europe, is that true democracy and a healthy civil society are inextricably connected. This is a view that we share. The European Commission and the ECtHR have in several cases held that pluralism is one of the essential features of a health democratic society. Pluralism will be promoted by a healthy civil society (see Section V.6). In this context, we have analysed which rules and practices exist with respect to CSOs and to what extent these promote or inhibit a flourishing and pluralistic civil society. The findings of our analysis are set out in the last paragraph of each section of the survey (Chapter 4), in which a particular aspect of CSO law is examined.",,,10.1017/9781316536407.006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047913040,,0

Furthermore, most MPA related studies are carried out for coastal ecosystems, especially tropical coral reefs. The valuation of remote marine ecosystems is rare. The main objective of this paper is to estimate public willingness to pay (WTP) for alternative management regimes of a network of offshore MPAs in the North Sea under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). In a baseline valuation study carried out just before the adoption of the MSFD, beach visitors and a random sample of coastal and non-coastal residents were asked for their preferences for two alternative management options of three remote, ecologically sensitive areas with multiple use conflicts. Despite the lack of public awareness and familiarity with the offshore marine areas, a majority of 70% is willing to pay extra tax for their protection. Using a conservative value elicitation procedure, Dutch households are willing to pay on average maximum 0.25% of their annual disposable income to ban access and economic use. This serves as an indicator of what a network of remote MPAs in the MSFD is allowed to cost according to the Dutch tax payer.",,"[""Contingent valuation"",""Marine biodiversity"",""Marine protected areas"",""Marine Strategy Framework Directive"",""Non-use value"",""Public willingness to pay""]",10.1016/j.marpol.2016.03.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960326153,,0

Background: Praise influences experiences of employees. Design: Web-based, cross-sectional explorative survey design. Methods: A structured questionnaire was used to measure praise given by nurse unit managers as perceived by nurses (n = 383; 49% response rate) working with surgical patients. Data were collected between December 2009-January 2010. Several variables assessed the major concepts under study.

Results: Praise was received often/very often by 31·6% of participants. Compared with nurses receiving praise rarely/very rarely those who received it often/rather showed more job satisfaction, stated they had more opportunities to practice professionally, described a more positive work climate and were more committed to the organization such as being proud to work at and willing to make effort for the unit and hospital. There was no difference between the groups regarding workload. Main findings of the regression analysis were that nurses display their organizational commitment by not thinking about leaving the current workplace and those who value professional recognition are likelier to receive praise than their counterparts.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background: Worldwide, dengue is an unrelenting economic and health burden. Dengue outbreaks have become increasingly common, which place great strain on health infrastructure and services. Early warning models could allow health systems and vector control programmes to respond more cost-effectively and efficiently. Methodology/Principal Findings: The Shewhart method and Endemic Channel were used to identify alarm variables that may predict dengue outbreaks. Five country datasets were compiled by epidemiological week over the years 2007-2013. These data were split between the years 2007-2011 (historic period) and 2012-2013 (evaluation period). Associations between alarm/ outbreak variables were analysed using logistic regression during the historic period while alarm and outbreak signals were captured during the evaluation period. These signals were combined to form alarm/ outbreak periods, where 2 signals were equal to 1 period. Alarm periods were quantified and used to predict subsequent outbreak periods. Across Mexico and Dominican Republic, an increase in probable cases predicted outbreaks of hospitalised cases with sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPV) of 93%/ 83% and 97%/ 86% respectively, at a lag of 1-12 weeks. An increase in mean temperature ably predicted outbreaks of hospitalised cases in Mexico and Brazil, with sensitivities and PPVs of 79%/ 73% and 81%/ 46% respectively, also at a lag of 1-12 weeks. Mean age was predictive of hospitalised cases at sensitivities and PPVs of 72%/ 74% and 96%/ 45% in Mexico and Malaysia respectively, at a lag of 4-16 weeks. Conclusions/Significance: An increase in probable cases was predictive of outbreaks, while meteorological variables, particularly mean temperature, demonstrated predictive potential in some countries, but not all. While it is difficult to define uniform variables applicable in every country context, the use of probable cases and meteorological variables in tailored early warning systems could be used to highlight the occurrence of dengue outbreaks or indicate increased risk of dengue transmission.","[""Asia"",""Dengue"",""Disease Outbreaks"",""Hospitalization"",""Humans"",""Latin America"",""Models, Statistical"",""Seasons""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0157971,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977591641,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157971&type=printable,0

ARF etiologies are numerous, and despite extensive diagnostic workflow, some patients remain with undetermined ARF etiology. Methods: This is a post-hoc study of a prospective multicenter cohort performed on 1011 critically ill hematological patients. Relationship between ARF etiology and hospital mortality was assessed using a multivariable regression model adjusting for confounders. Results: This study included 604 patients with ARF. All patients underwent noninvasive diagnostic tests, and a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 155 (25.6%). Definite diagnoses were classified into four exclusive etiological categories: pneumonia (44.4%), non-infectious diagnoses (32.6%), opportunistic infection (10.1%) and undetermined (12.9%), with corresponding hospital mortality rates of 40, 35, 55 and 59%, respectively. Overall hospital mortality was 42%. By multivariable analysis, factors associated with hospital mortality were invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (OR 7.57 (95% CI 3.06–21.62); p < 0.005), use of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.65 (95% CI 1.07–2.55); p = 0.02), a SOFA score >7 (OR 3.32 (95% CI 2.15–5.15); p < 0.005) and an undetermined ARF etiology (OR 2.92 (95% CI 1.71–5.07); p < 0.005). Conclusions: In patients with hematological malignancies and ARF, up to 13% remain with undetermined ARF etiology despite comprehensive diagnostic workup. Undetermined ARF etiology is independently associated with hospital mortality. Studies to guide second-line diagnostic strategies are warranted.

All Rights Reserved.Since its introduction in 1954, the Soil Conservation Service curve number (SCS-CN) method has become the standard tool, in practice, for estimating an event-based rainfall-runoff response. However, because of its empirical origins, the SCS-CN method is restricted to certain geographic regions and land use types. Moreover, it does not describe the spatial variability of runoff. To move beyond these limitations, we present a new theoretical framework for spatially lumped, event-based rainfall-runoff modeling. In this framework, we describe the spatially lumped runoff model as a point description of runoff that is upscaled to a watershed area based on probability distributions that are representative of watershed heterogeneities. The framework accommodates different runoff concepts and distributions of heterogeneities, and in doing so, it provides an implicit spatial description of runoff variability. Heterogeneity in storage capacity and soil moisture are the basis for upscaling a point runoff response and linking ecohydrological processes to runoff modeling. For the framework, we consider two different runoff responses for fractions of the watershed area: “prethreshold” and “threshold-excess” runoff. These occur before and after infiltration exceeds a storage capacity threshold. Our application of the framework results in a new model (called SCS-CNx) that extends the SCS-CN method with the prethreshold and threshold-excess runoff mechanisms and an implicit spatial description of runoff. We show proof of concept in four forested watersheds and further that the resulting model may better represent geographic regions and site types that previously have been beyond the scope of the traditional SCS-CN method.","[""Event-based model"",""Lumped modeling"",""Rainfall-runoff modeling"",""Rainfall-runoff response"",""Scs-cn methods"",""Soil conservation service curve numbers"",""Theoretical framework"",""Thresholds""]","[""event-based model"",""exponential rainfall"",""SCS-CN method"",""soil moisture"",""spatially lumped model"",""thresholds""]",10.1002/2015WR018439,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977100477,https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/2015WR018439,0

Not only is their physical and mental health exposed to multiple stresses, but also their access to health care in Germany is legally restricted. Up to now, there is very limited scientific literature investigating the health-outcomes of asylum seekers in Germany. The aim of this study was to provide prevalence data on the morbidity and vaccination status of asylum seekers in a medium-sized German city. We used a structured questionnaire in a cross-sectional study on 214 adult asylum seekers (182 males, 24 females, 8 unknown) in Halle, Germany, 2015. The questionnaire inquired about the respondent’s self-reported physical health and vaccination status and assessed their mental health using the Hopkins-Symptom-Checklist-25 and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. Pain (37.9 %) and psychological illness (depression: 54.7 %, anxiety disorder: 40.2 %; post-traumatic stress disorder: 18.2 %) were the most prevalent complaints. Among asylum seekers with psychological complaints, co-morbidity was high (64.2 % had more than one psychological disease). 5.6 % of the respondents mentioned suicidal thoughts. The prevalence of chronic diseases was low. We suggest interventions to improve asylum seekers’ health on two levels: first, the obligatory initial medical examination after the refugees’ arrival at the reception centre should be complemented with questions related to the vaccination status and the most common complaints including pain and psychological diseases. Second, medical infrastructure should be expanded to better serve the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse patient populations, so that those screened positive can be referred for early diagnosis and treatment.","[""Adult"",""Anxiety Disorders"",""Chronic Disease"",""Cities"",""Depressive Disorder"",""Female"",""Germany"",""Health Status"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Mental Health"",""Morbidity"",""Prevalence"",""Refugees"",""Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Urban Population"",""Vaccination""]","[""Asylum seekers"",""Health"",""Mental health"",""Pain"",""Refugees"",""Vaccination""]",10.1007/s10654-016-0148-4,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962866742,,0

A longitudinal difference in differences approach to IEA data from 1991 to 2006,"© 2016, Rosén and Gustafsson.Research on effects of home computer use on children’s development of cognitive abilities and skills has yielded conflicting results, with some studies showing positive effects, others no effects, and yet others negative effects. These studies have typically used non-experimental designs and one of the main reasons for the conflicting results is that studies differ with respect to how well they control for selection bias in comparisons of children with different amounts of computer use. The current study takes advantage of data from international comparative studies of educational achievement and uses the trend design of these studies to conduct longitudinal analyses at the country level. This allows for a difference in differences approach which effectively controls for within-country selection bias, time-invariant country-level omitted variables, and random errors of measurement in the independent and dependent variables. The empirical investigations are based on data from the IEA 10-Year Trend Study and the PIRLS 2001 and 2006 studies. For these studies, information about frequency of home computer use is available in the student questionnaire. The main analytical approach employed in the paper is regression estimation based on micro-data, with fixed country effects and cluster-robust standard-errors. This approach allows estimation of main effects of home computer use and interaction effects with student characteristics (gender and socio-economic status). For both data sets negative effects of home computer use on achievement are found.

Microfauna analysis showed the prevalence of testate amoebas (Euglypha spp. prevalent), rotifers and attached ciliate Epistylis plicatis. Low organic load, high sludge-age and high concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) were well correlated to the growth of Vorticella campanula and Vaginicola sp. Testate amoebas (Euglypha sp. and Arcella sp.) were the most representative group in WWTPs treating also olive mills effluents. Sludge Biotic Index (SBI) showed, for the investigated plants, an optimal to good depuration efficiency (I and II class quality) but it seemed not adequately responsive when olive mills wastewater (rich in phenols) was mixed with the municipal one. Further investigations should be conducted to explain this result. Filamentous bacteria analysis revealed a higher sensitivity of microorganisms to both influent chemical characteristics and WWTPs operational parameters. In most part of the WWTPs, dysfunctions due to the proliferation of filamentous bacteria were detected. In all WWTPs subjected to foaming, the morphotype Nocardia Amarae Like Organisms (NALO), associated with Type 1851 and 0041, was identified as responsible of the foaming.

Material and methods: Questionnaires regarding contraceptive use and pregnancies were sent to random samples of 19-year-old women in 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 (n = 4732). Results: Current contraceptive use was higher in 2001 (78%) (p < 0.01) and 2011 (69%) (p < 0.05) compared with 1981 (60%) and 1991 (62%). Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) was the most common form of contraception throughout (p < 0.0001). The use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC = implants, intrauterine contraception) and progestogen-only pills increased over time (p < 0.01). Mental side effects as a reason for CHC cessation increased over time and was the most common reason for cessation of CHC in 2011 (p < 0.001). Contraceptive use was lower in women from low SES areas (p < 0.05) in 2011.

Skills and Cities analyses these factors and looks at the implications for urban and regional policy across a range of European cities. Drawing conclusions from the Netherlands and Scandinavian cities Copenhagen and Helsinki, this book sheds new light on the debate about the importance of jobs and urban amenities for attracting high-skilled employees. This edited collection brings together international literature and individual residential experiences from different cities, presenting policy simulations and highlighting the differences between urban and suburban groups. Subsequent chapters discuss the location preference and settlement process of international migrants and students in an attempt to understand what it is that attracts highly-skilled workers to a particular area. This book concludes by expertly drawing together the key issues surrounding the residential behaviour of highly educated workers and students.

All rights reserved.This paper describes a new mathematical procedure to calculate the periodic steady state of the sequencing batch reactor (SBR). This new procedure allows the direct calculation of the steady state profiles of biomass and substrate in the SBR without calculating the dynamics of the system from start up to steady state. The procedure is based on the mass balances of biomass (X) and substrate (S) and the steady state profiles are obtained by imposing the condition that the integrals of dX and dS over a complete cycle are both equal to 0. The results obtained by the proposed technique are compared against the steady state results obtained by dynamic simulation. The numerical accuracy of the procedure is discussed and the procedure is applied to show the effect of the operating parameters (solids residence time (SRT), hydraulic residence time (HRT), length of the phases and number of cycles) on the steady state biomass and substrate concentrations. We show how the model can be used for various applications like: optimisation of operating parameters for a minimum reactor volume; simulation of the competition between filamentous and floc-forming bacteria for bulking control; calculation of the minimum volumetric mass transfer coefficient required to maintain a desired oxygen concentration. It is hoped that the procedure described in this paper will facilitate the use of mathematical models for the design of SBR's. Of course, it will be the responsibility of the users of this new method to use it with the appropriate kinetic model and parameter values.","[""Biological waste water treatment"",""Hydraulic residence time"",""Optimisations"",""Sequencing batch reactors"",""Simulation"",""Steady state"",""Substrate concentrations"",""Volumetric mass transfer coefficient""]","[""Optimisation"",""Sequencing batch reactors"",""Simulation"",""Steady state""]",10.1016/j.jece.2016.07.032,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84981531512,,0

All rights reserved.Spatial and temporal characteristics of outdoor heat stress for a redevelopment area in Gothenburg, Sweden, in a climate change perspective, using mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) as a proxy for heat stress is presented. The impact of climate change on Tmrt was evaluated using statistically downscaled data from a regional climate model. The simulated average Tmrt for the future scenarios was not higher than for today's climate, because the increased longwave radiation fluxes caused by higher temperatures were offset by reduced shortwave radiation fluxes caused by increased cloudiness. The spatial pattern of Tmrt in the study area during warm and clear weather is primarily governed by the shadow patterns of buildings and vegetation. The highest average-daytime Tmrt was found at open locations, but because open areas also have the highest frequency of sunlit occasions, this does not necessarily imply that open areas are most prone to heat-stress. When considering only occasions during clear and warm weather situations, the highest Tmrt were usually found close to sun-exposed, south-facing walls. Under these criteria, denser urban environments have lower heat stress than more open urban environments. The warmest areas were also found to be the warmest areas in the future as well. Tree-shadows are an effective measure to reduce daytime Tmrt. Trees was found to have the largest impact on Tmrt in open areas where vegetation is sparse, especially when the distance to the nearest ""cool"" place is used as a measure of heat-stress.",,"[""Göteborg"",""Mean radiant temperature"",""Spatial variability"",""Statistical downscaling"",""Sweden"",""Vegetation""]",10.1016/j.scs.2016.04.004,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964689406,,0

As panels contain potentially toxic elements, unconventional, complex and costly procedures are required to avoid environmental health risks and in countries where environmental awareness and economic resources are limited this may be especially problematic. This work was designed to investigate potential risks from improper disposal of these panels. To accomplish this aim an exhausted panel was broken into pieces and these were placed in water for 30 days. The resulting leached solution was analyzed to determine chemical release or used in toto, to determine its potential toxicity in established tests. The end points were seed germination (on Cucumis sativus and Lens culinaris) and effects on early development in three larval models: two crustaceans, Daphnia magna and Artemia salina, and the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Our results show that the panels release small amounts of electrolytes (Na, Ca and Mg) into solution, along with antimony and manganese, with a concentration under the accepted maximum contaminant level, and nickel at a potentially toxic concentration. Developmental defects are seen in the plant and animal test organisms after experimental exposure to the whole solution leached from the broken panel. The toxic effects revealed in in vitro tests are sufficient to attract attention considering that they are exerted on both plants and aquatic animals and that the number of old PVPs in disposal sites will be very high.","[""Animal test organisms"",""Environmental awareness"",""Environmental health risks"",""Germination index"",""Maximum contaminant levels"",""Naupliar eyes development"",""Photovoltaic panels"",""Potentially toxic elements"",""Animals"",""Artemia"",""Biological Assay"",""Cucumis sativus"",""Daphnia"",""Electronic Waste"",""Germination"",""Lens Plant"",""Paracentrotus"",""Refuse Disposal"",""Solar Energy"",""Toxicity Tests"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Germination index"",""Heavy metals cytotoxicity"",""Naupliar eyes development""]",10.1016/j.envpol.2016.06.048,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989909485,,0

This is not to say that in Bangladesh, where full liberal democracy is not in place, ordinary citizens have no values and idea(l)s of democracy and citizenship. On the contrary, in order to make sense of the intricate connection between democratic idea(l)s, and violent imaginations and practices, we focus in particular on the process of what we call the vernacularisation of democratic politics. We connect this process to the appropriation of citizenship and nationalism, by ordinary but radically differently-positioned people, in their daily realities. We demonstrate that widely shared imaginations of Bangladeshi-ness, as Bengali-ness or Muslim-ness, and of Bengalis/Muslims as the true nation and citizens of Bangladesh, are intimately connected with popular understandings and practices of democracy, which are based on the exclusion of the not-genuine-Bengalis, with the legitimisation and continuation of violence, and the exclusion of ethnic minorities in the Chittagong Hills.",,"[""Bangladesh"",""citizenship"",""democracy"",""nationalism"",""South Asia"",""the Chittagong Hills"",""violence""]",10.1163/15685314-04506004,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85031706755,,0

Freshwater pearl mussel populations were classed as: (i) apparently extinct in 11 rivers, (ii) not successfully recruiting in 44 rivers, and (iii) evidence of recent successful recruitment in 71 rivers. On a regional basis, a high proportion of extant populations were located in North and West Scotland. In all regions extant populations were characterised by low pearl mussel densities, with 97 of 115 extant Scottish populations defined as ‘rare’ (0.1–0.9 mussels per 1 m 2) or ‘scarce’ (1.0–9.9 mussels per 1 m 2). Only 18 Scottish rivers now hold pearl mussel populations in densities that are considered to be ‘common’ (10–19.9 mussels per 1 m 2) or ‘abundant’ (>20 mussels per 1 m 2). Based on survey evidence, the number of apparently extinct pearl mussel populations in Scottish rivers is now 73. The decline is particularly pronounced in the West Highlands and Western Isles strongholds.

The CD38 molecule, with its high expression on multiple myeloma cells, appears a suitable target for antibody therapy. Prompted by this, we used three different CD38 antibody sequences to generate second-generation retroviral CD38- chimeric antigen receptor constructs with which we transduced T cells from healthy donors and multiple myeloma patients. We then evaluated the preclinical efficacy and safety of the transduced T cells. Irrespective of the donor and antibody sequence, CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells proliferated, produced inflammatory cytokines and effectively lysed malignant cell lines and primary malignant cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia and multi-drug resistant multiple myeloma in a cell-dose, and CD38-dependent manner, despite becoming CD38-negative during culture. CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells also displayed significant anti-tumor effects in a xenotransplant model, in which multiple myeloma tumors were grown in a human bone marrow-like microenvironment. CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells also appeared to lyse the CD38+ fractions of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells, monocytes, natural killer cells, and to a lesser extent T and B cells but did not inhibit the outgrowth of progenitor cells into various myeloid lineages and, furthermore, were effectively controllable with a caspase-9-based suicide gene. These results signify the potential importance of CD38-chimeric antigen receptor-transduced T cells as therapeutic tools for CD38+ malignancies and warrant further efforts to diminish the undesired effects of this immunotherapy using appropriate strategies.","[""Animals"",""Antigens, CD38"",""Cytokines"",""Cytotoxicity, Immunologic"",""Disease Models, Animal"",""Flow Cytometry"",""Gene Expression"",""Gene Transfer Techniques"",""Genes, Transgenic, Suicide"",""Hematopoietic Stem Cells"",""Humans"",""Immunotherapy"",""Lymphocyte Activation"",""Mice"",""Mice, Knockout"",""Multiple Myeloma"",""Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell"",""Recombinant Fusion Proteins"",""T-Lymphocytes"",""Transduction, Genetic"",""Tumor Burden""]",,10.3324/haematol.2015.137620,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964723093,https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2015.137620,0

All rights reserved.Otolith shape can be used to identify ecotypes of the Icelandic cod (Gadus morhua) stock. The use of data storage tags has increased our knowledge of the stock structure of Icelandic cod. The profiles of tagged cod reveal different migratory strategies. This has led to the definition of two ecotypes within the cod stock. Frontal ecotypes reside in deep waters during feeding season and express a highly variable temperature profile associated with thermal fronts, while coastal ecotypes stay in shallow waters all year round. In this study, the data storage tag profiles were analysed with cluster analysis, which revealed the existence of an intermediate behaviour that expresses a variable depth profile and feeding migration that is both shorter in time and not as deep. The main objective was to develop a morphological key based on otoliths to distinguish the ecotypes. The shape of the otoliths was extracted with shape measurements and fast Fourier transforms. A discriminant function analysis indicated a difference in morphology between the ecotypes, resulting in successful classification.",,,10.1139/cjfas-2016-0307,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034440993,,0

The aim of this study is to predict and analyse the future evolution of land use and land cover (LULC) in the Stubai Valley, Central Alps. We propose a computational Population Dynamics P system (PDP) model that incorporates the main LULC change processes like plant production, grazing, abandonment and reforestation. The advantages of our LULC-PDP model are: (1) the possibility to consider a large number of wild and domestic animals of different species and LULC, (2) the parallel and interdependent evolution of processes, animals and LULC, (3) the easy introduction of new processes and, hence, (4) the straightforward application of the model in other study areas. We simulate LULC changes from 2003 to 2033 in three different scenarios: (1) continuation of current land use, (2) slight reduction in land-use intensity and (3) strong reduction in land-use intensity. Furthermore, we use response-surface models that relate the response variable area and livestock annual variation, allowing better interpretation of LULC changes. The results show the accurate functioning of our model as a prediction tool. We see how agriculturally used grasslands progressively decrease, whereas the forest area increases in all simulated scenarios. The most likely zones to be abandoned are found in the intermediate altitudinal range between 1500 and 2150. m, mostly on steep slopes (>30°). The reduction in the number of cattle is closely linked to the decrease in grazing land. As this tendency questions the conservation of traditional agricultural land, it is important to apply new strategies to preserve these cultural landscapes and the multiple ecosystem services for future generations before they disappear definitively.","[""Agricultural abandonments"",""Agricultural landscapes"",""Human-environment systems"",""Land use and land cover"",""Land use and land cover change"",""Landscape dynamics"",""LULC change"",""Response surface models""]","[""Agricultural landscape"",""Human environment system"",""Landscape dynamics"",""LULC change"",""PDP models""]",10.1016/j.ecolmodel.2015.11.016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951783536,https://digital.csic.es/bitstream/10261/128939/1/restringido.pdf,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery. All rights reserved.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the Cavalier trial was to evaluate the safety and performance of the Perceval sutureless aortic valve in patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR). We report the 30-day clinical and haemodynamic outcomes from the largest study cohort with a sutureless valve. METHODS: FromFebruary 2010 to September 2013, 658 consecutive patients (mean age 77.8 years; 64.4% females; mean logistic EuroSCORE 10.2%) underwent AVR in 25 European Centres. Isolated AVRs were performed in 451 (68.5%) patients with a less invasive approach in 219 (33.3%) cases. Of the total, 40.0% were octogenarians. Congenital bicuspid aortic valve was considered an exclusion criterion. RESULTS: Implantation was successful in 628 patients (95.4%). In isolated AVR through sternotomy, the mean cross-clamp time and the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time were 32.6 and 53.7 min, and with the less invasive approach 38.8 and 64.5 min, respectively. The 30-day overall and valve-related mortality rates were 3.7 and 0.5%, respectively. Valve explants, stroke and endocarditis occurred in 0.6, 2.1 and in 0.1% of cases, respectively. Preoperative mean and peak pressure gradients decreased from 44.8 and 73.24 mmHg to 10.24 and 19.27 mmHg at discharge, respectively. The mean effective orifice area improved from 0.72 to 1.46 cm2. CONCLUSIONS: The current 30-day results show that the Perceval valve is safe (favourable haemodynamic effect and low complication rate), and can be implanted with a fast and reproducible technique after a short learning period. Short cross-clamp and CPB times were achieved in both isolated and combined procedures. The Perceval valve represents a promising alternative to biological AVR, especially with a less invasive approach and in older patients.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Aortic Valve"",""Device Removal"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Heart Valve Prosthesis"",""Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation"",""Hemodynamics"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Prospective Studies"",""Prosthesis Design""]","[""Aortic valve replacement"",""Multicentre study"",""Sutureless aortic valve prosthesis""]",10.1093/ejcts/ezv257,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962859051,https://academic.oup.com/ejcts/article-pdf/49/3/978/8067857/ezv257.pdf,0

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic process, implementation of treatment and changes in life situation in patients with acromegaly, focusing on sex-specific differences. Methods: Non-interventional patient-reported outcome study. 165 patients with clinically and biochemically proven acromegaly were questioned about the diagnostic process and utilization of health care by means of a self-developed standardized postal survey including questions on acromegaly symptoms experienced before diagnosis, number and specialty of consulted doctors, time to diagnosis and aftercare. Results: The diagnostic process took 2.9 (SD 4.53) years, during which 3.4 (SD 2.99) physicians were consulted. Women waited longer [4.1 (SD 5.53) years] than men [1.6 (SD 2.69) years; p = 0.001] for the correct diagnosis, and consulted more doctors in the process [4.0 (SD 2.99) vs. 2.7 (SD 2.84) doctors, p < 0.001, respectively]. In 48.5 % of patients, acromegaly was diagnosed by an endocrinologist (men: 45.1 %; women: 52.4 %). Overall disease duration from symptom onset until last surgery was 5.5 (SD 6.85) years, with no sex differences. A change in employment status was the most commonly reported event after diagnosis and a quarter of the patients stated that the illness had changed their lives.

Insights from 15 years of multidisciplinary observations at the arctic marine LTER site HAUSGARTEN,"© 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.Time-series studies of arctic marine ecosystems are rare. This is not surprising since polar regions are largely only accessible by means of expensive modern infrastructure and instrumentation. In 1999, the Alfred Wegener Institute, Helmholtz-Centre for Polar and Marine Research (AWI) established the LTER (Long-Term Ecological Research) observatory HAUSGARTEN crossing the Fram Strait at about 79°N. Multidisciplinary investigations covering all parts of the open-ocean ecosystem are carried out at a total of 21 permanent sampling sites in water depths ranging between 250 and 5500 m. From the outset, repeated sampling in the water column and at the deep seafloor during regular expeditions in summer months was complemented by continuous year-round sampling and sensing using autonomous instruments in anchored devices (i.e., moorings and free-falling systems). The central HAUSGARTEN station at 2500 m water depth in the eastern Fram Strait serves as an experimental area for unique biological in situ experiments at the seafloor, simulating various scenarios in changing environmental settings. Long-term ecological research at the HAUSGARTEN observatory revealed a number of interesting temporal trends in numerous biological variables from the pelagic system to the deep seafloor. Contrary to common intuition, the entire ecosystem responded exceptionally fast to environmental changes in the upper water column. Major variations were associated with a Warm-Water-Anomaly evident in surface waters in eastern parts of the Fram Strait between 2005 and 2008. However, even after 15 years of intense time-series work at HAUSGARTEN, we cannot yet predict with complete certainty whether these trends indicate lasting alterations due to anthropologically-induced global environmental changes of the system, or whether they reflect natural variability on multiyear time-scales, for example, in relation to decadal oscillatory atmospheric processes.","[""Anthropogenic impacts"",""Arctic ocean"",""Deep sea"",""HAUSGARTEN"",""Natural variability""]","[""Anthropogenic impact"",""Arctic Ocean"",""Deep sea"",""HAUSGARTEN"",""Natural variability""]",10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.10.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961129804,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2015.10.001,0

Gastrointestinal and nutritional problems in neurologically impaired children have been recently recognized as an integral part of their disease, often leading to growth failure and worsened quality of life for both children and caregivers. Nutritional support is essential for the optimal care of these children. Undernourished handicapped children might not respond properly to intercurrent diseases and suffer unnecessarily. On the other hand, restoring a normal nutritional status results in a better quality of life in many. The easiest and least invasive method to increase energy intake is to improve oral intake. However, oral intake can be maintained as long as there is no risk of aspiration, the child is growing well and the time required to feed the child remains within acceptable limits. When oral intake is unsafe, insufficient or too time consuming, enteral nutrition should be initiated. Damage to the developing central nervous system may result in significant dysfunction in the gastrointestinal tract and is reflected in impairment in oral-motor function, rumination, gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER), with or without aspiration, delayed gastric emptying and constipation. These problems can all potentially contribute to feeding difficulty in disabled children, carrying further challenging long-term management issues.","[""Child"",""Disabled Children"",""Enteral Nutrition"",""Feeding and Eating Disorders of Childhood"",""Gastroesophageal Reflux"",""Humans"",""Nervous System Diseases"",""Quality of Life""]","[""Constipation"",""Dysphagia"",""Enteral nutrition"",""Gastro-esophageal reflux"",""Malnutrition"",""Neurological impairment"",""Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy""]",10.1016/j.ejpn.2016.05.019,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989229029,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1518091/1/Quitadamo_Gastrointestinal_nutritional_problems.pdf,0

This model is not well-known in English-speaking countries, but appears to have much to offer practitioners and researchers. As part of a large EU research project (MeetingDem) the authors translated and utilised this model in piloting the Dutch Meeting Centre Support Programme in the UK. This is a local community placebased approach to post-diagnostic psychosocial support. It is aimed at people diagnosed with dementia alongside their families and has proven benefits. Design/methodology/approach - The Adaptation-Coping Model underpins the support provided by the Meeting Centre Programme. The model and its translation into the UK context are described. Focus groups were undertaken with people living with dementia (n=9) and family carers (n=6) at the UK Meeting Centre pilot. Examples from these focus groups are provided in order to illustrate different aspects of the model. Findings - The translated Adaptation-Coping (adjusting to change) Model provides a way for service users (people with dementia and families) to conceptualise their journey with dementia post-diagnosis, and potentially provides service providers and researchers with aims for treatment and support.

All rights reserved.This study aimed to identify the most essential input parameters in the assessment of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions along the pork production chain. We identified most essential input parameters by combining two sensitivity-analysis methods: the multiplier method and the method of elementary effects. The former shows how much an input parameter influences assessment of GHG emissions, whereas the latter shows the importance of input parameters on uncertainty in the output. For the method of elementary effects, uncertainty ranges were implemented only for input parameters that were identified as being most influential based on the multiplier method or that had large uncertainty ranges based on the literature. Results showed that the most essential input parameters are the feed-conversion ratio, the amount of manure, CH4 emissions from manure management and crop yields, especially of maize and barley. Combining the results of both methods allowed derivation of mitigation options, either based on innovations (e.g. novel feeding strategies) or on management strategies (e.g. reducing mortality rate), and formulation of options for improving reliability of the results. Mitigation options based on innovations were shown to be most effective when directed at improving the feed-conversion ratio; decreasing the amount of manure produced by pigs; improving maize, barley and wheat yields; decreasing the number of sows or piglets per growing pig needed and improving efficiency of N-fertiliser production. Mitigation options based on management strategies were shown to be most effective when farmers strive to reduce feed intake, reduce application of N fertiliser to maize and barley, and reduce the number of sows per growing pig needed towards best practices. Finally, the method of elementary effects showed that reliability of assessing GHG emissions of pork production could be improved when uncertainty ranges are reduced, for example, around direct and indirect N2O emissions of the main feed crops in the pig diet and the CH4 emissions of manure. Also the reliability could be improved by improving data quality of the most essential parameters. Combining two types of sensitivity-analysis methods identified the most essential input parameters in the pork production chain. With this combined analysis, mitigation options via innovations and management strategies were derived, and parameters were identified that improved reliability of the results.","[""Emission factors"",""Feed conversion ratios"",""Improving efficiency"",""Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)"",""Management strategies"",""Matrix perturbation"",""Mitigation options"",""Variability""]","[""Growing pigs"",""IPCC emission factors"",""Life cycle assessment"",""Matrix perturbation method"",""Sensitivity analysis"",""Variability""]",10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.081,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973421073,,0

Additionally, we built an empirical model of some key correlates and compared the etiology of presenteeism versus absenteeism. We used meta-analysis (in total, K=109 samples, N=175,965) to investigate the correlates of presenteeism and meta-analytic structural equation modeling to test the empirical model. Salient correlates of working while ill included general ill health, constraints on absenteeism (e.g., strict absence policies, job insecurity), elevated job demands and felt stress, lack of job and personal resources (e.g., low support and low optimism), negative relational experiences (e.g., perceived discrimination), and positive attitudes (satisfaction, engagement, and commitment). Moreover, our dual process model clarified how job demands and job and personal resources elicit presenteeism via both health impairment and motivational paths, and they explained more variation in presenteeism than absenteeism. The study sheds light on the controversial act of presenteeism, uncovering both positive and negative underlying mechanisms.

Design consistency assessment is a tool employed by designers to improve road safety. The case study involved a rural two-lane two-way road in Southern Italy located on a flat terrain without spiral transition curves between tangent segments and circular curves. Road alignment consistency was examined in two steps: by adopting standards in force in Italy based on the design speed profile and by plotting operating speed profile to determine the area bounded by the speed profile and the average weighted speed, and the standard deviation of operating speeds for each geometric segment. Operating speed prediction model, which returns the 85th percentile of the speed distribution of the only cars under free flow conditions, right weather conditions, and lighting was adopted.

Consumers of many regulated services, including energy and banking, need to make active moves to switch suppliers, with profound consequences for how well the market functions.We identify differences in expected gains across demographic groups, particularly with respect to age and income, the associated changes in activity and implications for policy. We find that potential gains and anticipated switching time are associated with changes in consumer activity, but with differences between markets, demographic groups and individuals. Rather than concentrate on the average consumer response, we find variations across demographic groups, and that well informed vulnerable consumers are not necessarily less responsive than others, once we control for their expectations.We conclude that sector regulators and agencies who wish to encourage consumer action need to differentiate their policies: strategies to emphasize potential gains and reduce anticipated switching time are the most likely to increase consumer activity, but programs need to be tailored to particular markets and target groups if they are to be effective in stimulating consumer activity.",,,10.1093/joclec/nhv041,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960803066,https://academic.oup.com/jcle/article-pdf/12/1/113/6778663/nhv041.pdf,0

Yet balancing economic gains and environmental consequences induced by trade is still hindered by a lack of quantification of these two factors, especially for the environmental problems those are more locally oriented, such as the atmospheric pollution. Based on an environmental input–output analysis for 2010, we contrast economic gains (value added) against atmospheric pollutant emissions (sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NOx), primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC)) and the widely concerned CO2 emissions associated with international and interprovincial exports from Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH), the most polluted area in China. Our results show that exports contributed 55–62% of BTH's production emissions and 54% of its total value added. BTH's large exports of metals and metal products, nonmetal mineral products, chemical and transportation and warehousing, generated a larger share of pollutant emissions (36–46% of BTH's total) than that of value added (17%) along the supply chain. Most of BTH's embodied emissions in exports go to neighboring provinces and the developed east coastal regions in China, although the economic returns are comparatively low. Among BTH, industrial production in Beijing and Tianjin lead to more pollutant emission than value added in Hebei, due to reliance on pollution-intensive product imports from Hebei. Our results call for refocusing and restructuring of BTH's industry and trade structures to balance the economic gains and environmental losses for each region.","[""Atmospheric pollutant emissions"",""Environmental consequences"",""Environmental input-output analysis"",""Exports"",""Fine particulate matter"",""Non-methane volatile organic compounds"",""Pollutant emission"",""Value added""]","[""BTH"",""CO2"",""Exports"",""Pollutant emissions"",""Value added""]",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.038,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963860016,http://manuscript.elsevier.com/S0306261916304822/pdf/S0306261916304822.pdf,0

The loglikelihood function is split into two parts that are weighted differently. The first part is associated with the key variables while the second part is associated with the related variables which may contribute to the forecasting of key variables. We derive asymptotic properties, including consistency and asymptotic normality, of the weighted maximum likelihood estimator. We show that this estimator outperforms the standard likelihood-based estimator in approximating the true unknown distribution of the data as well as in out-of-sample forecasting accuracy. We verify the new estimation method in a Monte Carlo study and investigate the role of different weights in different settings. In the context of forecasting gross domestic product growth, this key variable is typically observed at a low (quarterly) frequency while the supporting variables are observed at a high (monthly) frequency. We adopt a low frequency representation of the mixed frequency dynamic factor model and discuss the computational efficiencies of this approach.

Online service usage is an important component of the discourse of the “digital divide”, an emblematic term for the inequality of information and communication technology access. Design/methodology/approach – This paper is a quantitative analysis of internet and Facebook penetration coupled with economic strength (GDP/capita), literacy and degree of rural population. Findings – The findings reveal a heterogeneous pattern with a few African countries being digital oases and close to European levels, whereas the majority of the countries are still digital deserts. A strong correlation is found between economic strength and internet penetration. A generalist picture that Sub-Saharan is on the trajectory of closing the digital divide is an imprecise reflection of the reality. Research limitations/implications – It is argued that instead of measuring supply-side data, which has been the trend till now, the use of demand-side elements such as online service usage tells more about digital inequalities between countries. Practical implications – The research encourages internet firms to open up their eyes for Sub-Saharan Africa as an investment opportunity with an untapped gap of online usage. Social implications – The three-billion internet users on the planet are unevenly spread and under-represented in Africa. By drawing a heterogeneous online usage landscape, digital policy can be accurately steered toward countries with the largest needs.

Additionally, surface snow samples were collected in February 2009 during a traverse between Concordia Station located on the East Antarctic plateau and DDU. The record of atmospheric Hg(0) at DDU reveals particularities that are not seen at other coastal sites: a gradual decrease of concentrations over the course of winter, and a daily maximum concentration around midday in summer. Additionally, total mercury concentrations in surface snow samples were particularly elevated near DDU (up to 194.4 ng L-1) as compared to measurements at other coastal Antarctic sites. These differences can be explained by the more frequent arrival of inland air masses at DDU than at other coastal sites. This confirms the influence of processes observed on the Antarctic plateau on the cycle of atmospheric mercury at a continental scale, especially in areas subject to recurrent katabatic winds. DDU is also influenced by oceanic air masses and our data suggest that the ocean plays a dual role on Hg(0) concentrations. The open ocean may represent a source of atmospheric Hg(0) in summer whereas the sea-ice surface may provide reactive halogens in spring that can oxidize Hg(0).

Passive acoustic methods are developing as viable alternatives to visual surveys, particularly for small, inconspicuous species such as the harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena). Passive acoustic monitoring using a towed hydrophone array was carried out during an acoustic survey of clupeids in the Clyde Sea and surrounding sea lochs to identify spatial relationships between porpoises and their prey. Methods were developed to process passive acoustic data, successfully identifying porpoise echolocation clicks while discriminating them from the transmitted 120-kHz echosounder pulse and its reflections. To date, this has been a confounding factor which has made these survey techniques potentially incompatible. The highest biomass of pelagic fish was detected in the northernmost parts of the survey region, as were the largest number of porpoises. A moving average was used to examine the scale of the relationships identified, and it was found that while porpoises show no significant preferences for pelagic prey numbers at the smallest scales, they do show significant avoidance of larger areas (5+ km) with very low pelagic fish biomass. This study demonstrates that high-frequency passive acoustic monitoring can be used effectively alongside multifrequency fisheries echosounder surveys to provide novel insights into the trophic interactions between these species, and that further work will hopefully prove useful in improving the efficacy of management strategies for harbour porpoises.",,"[""clupeid"",""Clyde"",""fisheries acoustics"",""harbour porpoise"",""passive acoustic monitoring"",""predator-prey"",""spatial interactions""]",10.1093/icesjms/fsw013,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990924232,https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/73/8/2075/6765510/fsw013.pdf,0

Background Although African governments struggled to provide primary health care services in the context of a global economic crisis, civil society organisations (CSO) started mobilising settlement residents to respond to another crisis: the HIV and AIDS pandemic. These initiatives actively engaged patients, families and settlement residents to provide home-based care to HIV-infected patients. After 30 years, CHBC programmes continue to be appropriate in the context of changing health care needs in the population. Methods The study took place in 2011 and 2012 and was part of a multi-country study. It used a mixed method approach involving semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, structured interviews, service observations and a questionnaire survey. Findings Our research revealed long-standing presence of extensive mutual support amongst residents in many settlements, the invocation of cultural values that emphasise social relationships and organisation of people by CSO in care and support programmes. This laid the foundation for a locally conceived model of chronic care capable of addressing the new care demands arising from the country's changing burden of disease.

We conducted two parallel marketing studies aimed at revealing the most desirable characteristics for the commercialization of this product in each of the two markets, and made comparisons among consumers’ attitudes for several attributes (country of origin, carbon footprint, production method, ethical certification and packaging). Motivation for this study is the declining market share of the domestic early potato, considered an important crop in both countries, due to the competition from abroad. A focal aspect of this research is the recent public interest for social justice, traditionally reserved for products imported from developing countries, with respect to ethical products made in developed countries. The possibility for Italian and German early potatoes to regain important market shares depends on the ability to differentiate their potatoes from potatoes supplied by competing extra-European countries.

In selected patients, surgery can be technically feasible, although it is widely believed to be hazardous. As data regarding the outcome of this approach is sparse, we evaluated our institutional experience with salvage surgery. Materials and methods: Patients with a pulmonary resection for in-field locoregional recurrence or persistent tumor after high dose chemoradiotherapy (≥60 Gy) for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, were identified and retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 15 patients treated between January 2007 and August 2015 were eligible for evaluation. In 13 patients (87%), the indication for surgery was a locoregional recurrence, while 2 patients had persistent tumor. The prior median radiotherapy dose was 66 Gy (range 60-70). All patients underwent an anatomical resection, with 8 patients having a pneumonectomy, and all pathological specimens revealed the presence of viable tumor. The in-hospital morbidity rate was 40% (6 patients), and the 90-day mortality rate was 6.7% (1 patient). Median follow-up was 12.1 months. The estimated median overall and event-free survivals were 46 months and 43.6 months, respectively. Conclusion: Salvage surgery for locoregional recurrence or persistent tumor after high dose chemoradiotherapy, resulted in acceptable morbidity, mortality and promising outcome. It should be considered as a treatment option for selected patients.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung"",""Chemoradiotherapy"",""Combined Modality Therapy"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Kaplan-Meier Estimate"",""Lung Neoplasms"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Neoplasm Recurrence, Local"",""Neoplasm Staging"",""Salvage Therapy"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""Chemoradiotherapy"",""Locoregional recurrence"",""Non-small cell lung cancer"",""Salvage surgery"",""Survival""]",10.1016/j.lungcan.2016.02.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960405720,,0

A large investment into ELSI research from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Human Genomic Project budget in 1990 stimulated the growth of this emerging field; ELSI research has continued to develop and is starting to emerge as a field in its own right. The evolving subject matter of ELSI research continues to raise new research questions as well as prompt re-evaluation of earlier work and a growing number of scholars working in this area now identify themselves as ELSI scholars rather than with a particular discipline. Main text: Due to the international and interdisciplinary nature of ELSI research, scholars can often find themselves isolated from disciplinary or regionally situated support structures. We conducted a workshop with Early Career Researchers (ECRs) in Oxford, UK, and this paper discusses some of the particular challenges that were highlighted. While ELSI ECRs may face many of the universal challenges faced by ECRs, we argue that a number of challenges are either unique or exacerbated in the case of ELSI ECRs and discuss some of the reasons as to why this may be the case. We identify some of the most pressing issues for ELSI ECRs as: interdisciplinary angst and expertise, isolation from traditional support structures, limited resources and funding opportunities, and uncertainty regarding how research contributions will be measured. We discuss the potential opportunity to use web 2.0 technologies to transform academic support structures and address some of the challenges faced by ELSI ECRs, by helping to facilitate mentoring and support, access to resources and new accreditation metrics. Conclusion: As our field develops it is crucial for the ELSI community to continue looking forward to identify how emerging digital solutions can be used to facilitate the international and interdisciplinary research we perform, and to offer support for those embarking on, progressing through, and transitioning into an ELSI research career.","[""Accreditation"",""Bioethics"",""Career Choice"",""Cooperative Behavior"",""Ethicists"",""Ethics, Research"",""Genetic Research"",""Humans"",""Interdisciplinary Communication"",""International Cooperation"",""Internet"",""Research Personnel"",""Specialization"",""United Kingdom"",""United States""]","[""Collaboration"",""Early career researcher"",""ELSI"",""Interdisciplinary"",""Mentoring"",""Networks"",""Web 2.0""]",10.1186/s12910-016-0121-5,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979300831,https://bmcmedethics.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12910-016-0121-5,0

ARF etiologies are numerous, and despite extensive diagnostic workflow, some patients remain with undetermined ARF etiology. Methods: This is a post-hoc study of a prospective multicenter cohort performed on 1011 critically ill hematological patients. Relationship between ARF etiology and hospital mortality was assessed using a multivariable regression model adjusting for confounders. Results: This study included 604 patients with ARF. All patients underwent noninvasive diagnostic tests, and a bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed in 155 (25.6%). Definite diagnoses were classified into four exclusive etiological categories: pneumonia (44.4%), non-infectious diagnoses (32.6%), opportunistic infection (10.1%) and undetermined (12.9%), with corresponding hospital mortality rates of 40, 35, 55 and 59%, respectively. Overall hospital mortality was 42%. By multivariable analysis, factors associated with hospital mortality were invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (OR 7.57 (95% CI 3.06–21.62); p < 0.005), use of invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 1.65 (95% CI 1.07–2.55); p = 0.02), a SOFA score >7 (OR 3.32 (95% CI 2.15–5.15); p < 0.005) and an undetermined ARF etiology (OR 2.92 (95% CI 1.71–5.07); p < 0.005). Conclusions: In patients with hematological malignancies and ARF, up to 13% remain with undetermined ARF etiology despite comprehensive diagnostic workup. Undetermined ARF etiology is independently associated with hospital mortality. Studies to guide second-line diagnostic strategies are warranted.

Molecular Ecology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Understanding the spatial scale at which selection acts upon adaptive genetic variation in natural populations is fundamental to our understanding of evolutionary ecology, and has important ramifications for conservation. The environmental factors to which individuals of a population are exposed can vary at fine spatial scales, potentially generating localized patterns of adaptation. Here, we compared patterns of neutral and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) variation within an island population of Berthelot's pipit (Anthus berthelotii) to assess whether landscape-level differences in pathogen-mediated selection generate fine-scale spatial structuring in these immune genes. Specifically, we tested for spatial associations between the distribution of avian malaria, and the factors previously shown to influence that distribution, and MHC variation within resident individuals. Although we found no overall genetic structure across the population for either neutral or MHC loci, we did find localized associations between environmental factors and MHC variation. One MHC class I allele (ANBE48) was directly associated with malaria infection risk, while the presence of the ANBE48 and ANBE38 alleles within individuals correlated (positively and negatively, respectively) with distance to the nearest poultry farm, an anthropogenic factor previously shown to be an important determinant of disease distribution in the study population. Our findings highlight the importance of considering small spatial scales when studying the patterns and processes involved in evolution at adaptive loci.","[""Animals"",""Environment"",""Evolution, Molecular"",""Genetic Variation"",""Genetics, Population"",""Islands"",""Major Histocompatibility Complex"",""Malaria, Avian"",""Passeriformes"",""Selection, Genetic""]","[""Berthelot's pipit"",""major histocompatibility complex"",""malaria"",""principal components of neighbour matrices""]",10.1111/mec.13759,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84986593202,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/mec.13759,0

We followed all married couples in Sweden, born 1902 to 1942, in hospital records from 1987 to 2002, and found that individuals whose spouse had a hip fracture had an increased risk of hip fracture. Introduction: The purpose of this study was to determine whether spouses of hip fracture patients have an elevated risk of hip fracture. Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all couples married for at least 5 years in Sweden and born between 1902 and 1942 (n = 904,451) and all patients registered with a hip fracture (n = 218,285) in the National Inpatients Register in Sweden from 1987 to 2002. Results: During the period 1987 to 2002 hip fractures occurred among spouses in 4212 married couples. The hazard ratio (HR) for hip fracture in a married woman following hip fracture in the husband was 1.11 (95 % confidence interval 1.07 to 1.16) compared to a woman whose husband did not have hip fracture. The corresponding HR for a married man was 1.20 (1.15 to 1.26) compared to a man whose wife did not have hip fracture. The risk was significantly elevated over the age range 60 to 90 years. The increased risk for hip fracture among spouses remained after adjustments for income, education, geographical latitude and urbanisation. In a common model with spouses and their siblings, the HR for spousal effect were 1.63 (1.01 to 2.64) and for sibling effect 2.18 (1.55 to 3.06) compared to married with spouse and sibling respectively without hip fracture. Conclusion: The novel finding of an increased risk for hip fracture among spouses provides evidence indicating that there is a homogamy effect due to common social and lifestyle factors but could also be due to assortative mating.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Family Health"",""Female"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""Hip Fractures"",""Humans"",""Life Style"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Osteoporotic Fractures"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Factors"",""Sex Factors"",""Socioeconomic Factors"",""Spouses"",""Sweden""]","[""Assortative mating"",""Hip fracture"",""Homogamy"",""Osteoporosis""]",10.1007/s00198-016-3738-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984791984,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00198-016-3738-9.pdf,0

The purpose of this paper is to observe the connections between smart city features as conceptualized in the framework proposed by Giffinger et al. (2007) and new technologies as tools, and sustainability as the goal. Design/methodology/approach – The connections are identified through a content analysis performed using NVivo on official reports issued by organizations, known as industry players within smart city projects, listed in the Navigant Research Report 2013. Findings – The results frame ICT and sustainability as “across-the-board elements” because they connect with all of the services provided to communities in a smart city and play a key role in smart city planning. Specifically, sustainability and ICT can be seen as tools to enable the smartization process. Research limitations/implications – An all-in-one perspective emerges by embedding sustainability and ICT in smart interventions; further research could be conduct through direct interviews to city managers and industry players in order to understand their attitude towards the development of smart city projects. Practical implications – Potential approaches emerging from this research are useful to city managers or large corporations partnering with local agencies in order to increase the opportunities for the long-term success of smart projects.

According to the most widely used database (IA2008; Warren and Brandt, 2008), the ice absorption coefficient reaches values lower than 10-3 m-1 around 400 nm. These values were obtained from a vertical profile of spectral radiance measured in a single snow layer at Dome C in Antarctica.We reproduced this experiment using an optical fiber inserted in the snow to record 56 profiles from which 70 homogeneous layers were identified. Applying the same estimation method on every layer yields 70 ice absorption spectra. They present a significant variability but absorption coefficients are overall larger than IA2008 by 1 order of magnitude at 400-450 nm. We devised another estimation method based on Bayesian inference that treats all the profiles simultaneously. It reduces the statistical variability and confirms the higher absorption, around 2×10-2 m-1 near the minimum at 440 nm. We explore potential instrumental artifacts by developing a 3-D radiative transfer model able to explicitly account for the presence of the fiber in the snow. The simulation shows that the radiance profile is indeed perturbed by the fiber intrusion, but the error on the ice absorption estimate is not larger than a factor of 2. This is insufficient to explain the difference between our new estimate and IA2008. The same conclusion applies regarding the plausible contamination by black carbon or dust, concentrations reported in the literature are insufficient. Considering the large number of profiles acquired for this study and other estimates from the Antarctic Muon and Neutrino Detector Array (AMANDA), we nevertheless estimate that ice absorption values around 10-2 m-1 at the minimum are more likely than under 10-3 m-1. A new estimate in the range 400-600 nm is provided for future modeling of snow, cloud, and sea-ice optical properties. Most importantly, we recommend that modeling studies take into account the large uncertainty of the ice absorption coefficient in the visible and that future estimations of the ice absorption coefficient should also thoroughly account for the impact of the measurement method.",,,10.5194/tc-10-2655-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995923601,https://www.the-cryosphere.net/10/2655/2016/tc-10-2655-2016.pdf,0

But to what extent have party finance laws encouraged homogenous financial conditions for fair party competition? This article draws on the level playing field conception prominent in theories of egalitarianism and tests the assumption that party finance regulation eliminates or reduces inequalities arising from unequal starting points. It analyzes data on the party finances of 47 parties in six European countries between 1960 and 2010. The findings indicate that party finance law has been effective in some countries. Specifically, despite significant legislative differences, the introduction of party finance law in Denmark and the Netherlands was most effective in encouraging financial convergence amongst parties and thus more similar financial conditions. The findings suggest that party finance regulation has not always accomplished creating a level playing field; wherever it did, quite different structures achieved similar outcomes.

We hypothesize that there are effects of sediment texture on the vertical distribution of MPB using chlorophyll a (chl a) as a proxy for MPB biomass and present results over a 2.5-year period. Four sites were sampled monthly: two sandy sites (A10 and A12) and two muddy sites (A0 and A14) on the intertidal flats of the Fraser River Estuary. At the two sandy sites, pigments were distributed down to 10 cm. High ratios of depth-integrated chl a to phaeopigments suggest that the chl a had been recently buried. In contrast, at the muddy sites, pigments were limited to the top 4 cm, with MBP in the top 1 cm contributing up to 60 % of the whole sediment core pigments. As a result, the depth-integrated chl a values were on average 2,044 mg m–2 (160–4,200) at A10 and 882 mg m−2 (183–2,569) at A12, the two sandy sites, and much higher than at the two muddy sites where averages of 84 mg m−2 (41–174) and 235 mg m−2 (77–854) were measured at A0 and A14, respectively. Despite these lower concentrations at the muddy sites than at the sandy sites, particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON) concentrations showed a homogenous vertical distribution at the two sandy sites. Such a homogeneous vertical distribution of chl a, POC, and PON suggests that vertical transport mechanisms were actively transporting organic material into and out of the sediment. These results suggest that MBP on sandy sediments play a very active role in providing food for herbivores and are interacting with the overlying water column in the sediment-water exchange processes during tidal cycles.","[""Biomass"",""Canada"",""Chlorophyll"",""Ecosystem"",""Estuaries"",""Geologic Sediments"",""Microalgae"",""Nitrogen"",""Rivers""]","[""Benthic microalgae"",""Chlorophyll a"",""Interstitial water"",""Intertidal flat"",""Microphytobenthos"",""Sandy and muddy sediment"",""Vertical distribution""]",10.1007/s11356-016-6571-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962714798,,0

BPA, a common and widely chemical contaminant acting as endocrine disruptor, accumulates in adipose tissue and may affect adipocyte metabolic and inflammatory functions. BPA, at low chronic doses, is now considered as an obesogen compound, and might contribute to the rise of metabolic syndrome, visceral adiposity and diabetes epidemics. The BPA worldwide presence in the environment is responsible for chronic exposure during vulnerable periods, such as foetal and neonatal life. The BPA source of contamination can occur via food, beverage, wastewater, air, dust and soil. BPA, as lipophilic compound, may accumulate into the adipose tissue already during foetal life and may affect adulthood health, through adverse effects on the growth and development of organs and tissues. Thus, based on several studies, it would be crucial to consider further actions aimed to refine risk assessment at least in vulnerable population, such as foetuses, infants and young children, to prevent metabolic diseases and obesity.","[""Air Pollutants, Occupational"",""Benzhydryl Compounds"",""Environmental Exposure"",""Humans"",""Metabolic Syndrome X"",""Phenols"",""Risk Assessment"",""Vulnerable Populations""]","[""Bisphenol A"",""Endocrine disruptors"",""Insulin resistance"",""Low-grade-inflammation"",""Obesity"",""Prenatal/neonatal exposure""]",10.1007/s40618-015-0336-1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959047736,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40618-015-0336-1.pdf,0

Drawing on the case of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), it addresses institutional entrepreneurship in an emerging environmental science-policy institution (ESPI) at a global scale. Drawing on ethnographic observations, semistructured interviews, and document analysis, we propose a detailed chronology of the genesis of the IPBES before focusing on the final phase of the negotiations toward the creation of the institution. We analyze the techniques and skills deployed by the chairman during the conference to handle the tensions at play both to prevent participants from deserting the negotiations arena and to prevent a lack of inclusiveness from discrediting the future institution. We stress that creating a new global environmental institution requires the situated exercise of an art of “having everybody on board” through techniques of inclusiveness that we characterize.

The case for mortality and cardiovascular disease,"© 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.Background: We implemented a novel method for providing contextual adverse event rates for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) programme through coordinated analyses of five RA registries, focusing here on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Methods: Each participating registry (Consortium of Rheumatology Researchers of North America (CORRONA) (USA), Swedish Rheumatology Quality of Care Register (SRR) (Sweden), Norfolk Arthritis Register (NOAR) (UK), CORRONA International (East Europe, Latin America, India) and Institute of Rheumatology, Rheumatoid Arthritis (IORRA) (Japan)) defined a main cohort from January 2000 onwards. To address comparability and potential bias, we harmonised event definitions and defined several subcohorts for sensitivity analyses based on disease activity, treatment, calendar time, duration of follow-up and RCT exclusions. Rates were standardised for age, sex and, in one sensitivity analysis, also HAQ. Results: The combined registry cohorts included 57 251 patients with RA (234 089 person-years) - 24.5% men, mean (SD) baseline age 58.2 (13.8) and RA duration 8.2 (11.7) years. Standardised registry mortality rates (per 100 person-years) varied from 0.42 (CORRONA) to 0.80 (NOAR), with 0.60 for RCT patients. Myocardial infarction and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) rates ranged from 0.09 and 0.31 (IORRA) to 0.39 and 0.77 (SRR), with RCT rates intermediate (0.18 and 0.42), respectively. Additional subcohort analyses showed small and mostly consistent changes across registries, retaining reasonable consistency in rates across the Western registries. Additional standardisation for HAQ returned higher mortality and MACE registry rates. Conclusions: This coordinated approach to contextualising RA RCT safety data demonstrated reasonable differences and consistency in rates for mortality and CVD across registries, and comparable RCT rates, and may serve as a model method to supplement clinical trial analyses for drug development programmes.","[""Aged"",""Antirheumatic Agents"",""Arthritis, Rheumatoid"",""Bias (Epidemiology)"",""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Humans"",""India"",""Japan"",""Latin America"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Myocardial Infarction"",""North America"",""Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"",""Registries"",""Sweden"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""Cardiovascular Disease"",""Epidemiology"",""Outcomes research"",""Rheumatoid Arthritis""]",10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-208698,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958092529,,0

Heterogeneity in within-family processes,"© 2016 American Psychological Association.This study aimed to gain a better understanding of the normative declines in adolescent disclosure and maternal knowledge over the course of adolescence, by assessing the underlying monitoring processes. Multilevel structural equation models were applied to 15 assessments among 479 families across 5 years (13 years at T1, 57% boys, 11% low socioeconomic status). Developmental declines in mother-perceived disclosure and knowledge were observed, which were partially explained by processes operating at the level of the family unit. On average, mothers were more knowledgeable in weeks with more disclosure and more solicitation, and adolescent disclosure was higher in weeks with more maternal solicitation and less control. The effect sizes and even the directions of these within-family correlations varied between families, however. This heterogeneity was partially explained by the level of maternal control and adolescent disclosure, and by the families' socioeconomic status. Within-family fluctuations in knowledge and disclosure were also correlated with fluctuations in relationship quality and adolescent and mother mood. Overall, these within-family processes explained up to 14% of the normative developmental decline in disclosure and 19% of the decline in knowledge. This study thus suggests that a wide variety in monitoring processes may drive normative declines in adolescent disclosure and maternal knowledge.","[""Adolescent"",""Adolescent Development"",""Disclosure"",""Family"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Male"",""Models, Psychological"",""Mother-Child Relations"",""Mothers"",""Psychology, Adolescent""]","[""Adolescent disclosure"",""Heterogeneity"",""Longitudinal"",""Parental monitoring"",""Within-person""]",10.1037/dev0000220,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85000624242,https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/2ee73c83-a9dd-4cd5-8056-1f6152fa33bf,0

This study performed an energy and GHG emissions analysis, using EROI and GHG savings potential respectively, as indicators of commercial viability for two systems: the Swedish Seafarm project's seaweed cultivation (0.5 ha), biogas and fertilizer biorefinery, and an estimation of the same system scaled up and adjusted to a cultivation of 10 ha. Based on a conservative estimate of biogas yield, neither the 0.5 ha case nor the up-scaled 10 ha estimates met the (commercial viability) target EROI of 3, nor the European Union Renewable Energy Directive GHG savings target of 60% for biofuels, however the potential for commercial viability was substantially improved by scaling up operations: GHG emissions and energy demand, per unit of biogas, was almost halved by scaling operations up by a factor of twenty, thereby approaching the EROI and GHG savings targets set, under beneficial biogas production conditions. Further analysis identified processes whose optimisations would have a large impact on energy use and emissions (such as anaerobic digestion) as well as others embodying potential for further economies of scale (such as harvesting), both of which would be of interest for future developments of kelp to biogas and fertilizer biorefineries.","[""Biorefineries"",""Economy of scale"",""Energy return on investments"",""EURED GHG savings"",""Macro-algae"",""Saccharina latissima""]","[""Biorefinery"",""Economy of scale"",""Energy return on investment (EROI)"",""EURED GHG savings"",""Saccharina latissima"",""Swedish macroalgae cultivation""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.07.220,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983638479,,0

Lower quality of the parent–adolescent relationship has been consistently associated with higher adolescent depressive symptoms, but discrepancies in perceptions of parents and adolescents regarding the quality of their relationship may be particularly important to consider. In the present study, we therefore examined how discrepancies in parents’ and adolescents’ perceptions of the parent–adolescent relationship were associated with early adolescent depressive symptoms, both concurrently and longitudinally over a 1-year period. Our sample consisted of 497 Dutch adolescents (57 % boys, Mage = 13.03 years), residing in the western and central regions of the Netherlands, and their mothers and fathers, who all completed several questionnaires on two occasions with a 1-year interval. Adolescents reported on depressive symptoms and all informants reported on levels of negative interaction in the parent–adolescent relationship. Results from polynomial regression analyses including interaction terms between informants’ perceptions, which have recently been proposed as more valid tests of hypotheses involving informant discrepancies than difference scores, suggested the highest adolescent depressive symptoms when both the mother and the adolescent reported high negative interaction, and when the adolescent reported high but the father reported low negative interaction. This pattern of findings underscores the need for a more sophisticated methodology such as polynomial regression analysis including tests of moderation, rather than the use of difference scores, which can adequately address both congruence and discrepancies in perceptions of adolescents and mothers/fathers of the parent–adolescent relationship in detail. Such an analysis can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of risk factors for early adolescent depressive symptoms.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Attitude"",""Child"",""Depression"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Male"",""Models, Statistical"",""Netherlands"",""Parent-Child Relations"",""Psychology, Adolescent"",""Regression Analysis"",""Risk Factors"",""Surveys and Questionnaires""]","[""Depressive symptoms"",""Difference scores"",""Early adolescence"",""Multiple informants"",""Parent–adolescent discrepancies"",""Polynomial regression analysis""]",10.1007/s10964-016-0503-5,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982283226,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10964-016-0503-5.pdf,0

Several theories proposed to account for the variation were reviewed. With this previous study as the point of departure, the current study was to identify determinants and mechanisms that can explain the substantial variation found in the relationship between parental education and school achievement across the 37 countries in the previous study. Methods: The effects estimated in Gustafsson et al. (TIMSS and PIRLS 2011: Relationships among reading, mathematics, and science achievement at the fourth grade—implications for early learning. pp 183–289, 2013) formed the empirical data of the current study. In a first step of analysis the total, direct and indirect effects were described for the 37 countries, focusing on countries with a high and low level in these three respects. In the second step of analysis, two indicators of characteristics of the educational system, the Gini index as a measure of degree of economic inequality and the HDI as a measure of general societal development, were related to the estimated coefficients. Results: We found different patterns of relations with the direct and the indirect effects of parental education, and the direct and indirect effects therefore tended to cancel, so that small or no total effects were found. We also found opposite results when we investigated bivariate correlations and when we investigated partial correlation with HDI and Gini. Conclusion: The pattern of empirical findings thus is more complex than expect. There is, potentially, a large number of factors outside of the home which may be of importance mediating the relation between parental education and student achievement. However, the data available for the current study does not allow investigation of such factors, so this will be tasks for further research.",,"[""Academic achievements"",""Early literacy and numeracy activities"",""Indirect effects"",""Literacy and numeracy abilities"",""Parental education"",""PIRLS"",""TIMSS""]",10.1186/s40536-016-0027-1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065119892,https://largescaleassessmentsineducation.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40536-016-0027-1,0

In this work, we have examined the impact of serum ANGPTL2 on improving cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: A prospective, monocentric cohort of consecutive type 2 diabetes patients (the SURDIAGENE cohort; total of 1353 type 2 diabetes patients; 58% men, mean ± SD age 64 ± 11 years) was followed for a median of 6.0 years for death as primary endpoint and major adverse CV events (MACE; i.e. CV death, myocardial infarction or stroke) as a secondary endpoint. Patients with end-stage renal disease, defined as a requirement for dialysis or a history of kidney transplantation, were excluded. Patients were grouped into quartiles according to ANGPTL2 concentrations at inclusion: <11.2 (Q1), 11.2–14.7 (Q2), 14.8–19.5 (Q3) or >19.5 (Q4) ng/ml. Results: During follow up, 367 patients (representing 4.5% of the total person-years) died and 290 patients (representing 3.7% of the total person-years) presented with MACE. Both the survival and MACE-free survival rates were significantly different between ANGPTL2 quartiles (logrank 82.12, p < 0.0001 for death; and logrank 65.14, p < 0.0001 for MACE). Patients with ANGPTL2 concentrations higher than 19.5 ng/ml (Q4) had a significantly higher risk of death and MACE than those with ANGPTL2 levels of 19.5 ng/ml or less (Q1–3) (HR for death 2.44 [95% CI 1.98, 3.00], p < 0.0001; HR for MACE 2.43 [95% CI 1.92, 3.06], p < 0.0001) after adjustment for sex, age and established CV risk factors. Using ANGPTL2 concentrations, prediction of the risk of mortality, as assessed by integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), was significantly improved (IDI 0.006 ± 0.002, p = 0.0002). Conclusions/interpretation: In patients with type 2 diabetes, serum ANGPTL2 concentrations were independently associated with death and MACE. Therefore, ANGPTL2 is a promising candidate biomarker for improving risk stratification in type 2 diabetes patients, and may prove to be a valuable therapeutic target.","[""Aged"",""Angiopoietins"",""Biomarkers"",""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Myocardial Infarction"",""Prospective Studies"",""Risk Factors"",""Stroke""]","[""Angiopoietin-like 2"",""ANGPTL2"",""Biomarker"",""Death"",""MACE"",""Type 2 diabetes""]",10.1007/s00125-016-4066-5,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982899113,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00125-016-4066-5.pdf,0

European Journal of Heart Failure © 2016 European Society of CardiologyAims: To describe the outcomes of pregnancy in women with pulmonary hypertension. Methods and results: In 2007 the European Registry on Pregnancy and Heart Disease was initiated by the European Society of Cardiology. Consecutive patients with all forms of cardiovascular disease, presenting with pregnancy, were enrolled with the aim of investigating the pregnancy outcomes. This subgroup of the cohort included 151 women with pulmonary hypertension (PH) either diagnosed by right heart catheterization or diagnosed as possible PH by echocardiographic signs, with 26% having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), in three subgroups: idiopathic (iPAH), associated with congenital heart disease (CHD-PAH), or associated with other disease (oPAH), and 74% having PH caused by left heart disease (LHD-PH, n = 112). Maternal mean age was 29.2 ± 5.6 years and 37% were nulliparous. Right ventricular systolic pressure was <50 mmHg in 59.6% of patients, 50–70 mmHg in 28.5% and >70 mmHg in 11.9%. In more than 75% of patients, the diagnosis of PH had been made before pregnancy. Maternal death up to 1 week after delivery occurred in five patients (3.3%), with another two out of 78 patients who presented for follow-up (2.6%), dying within 6 months after delivery. The highest mortality was found in iPAH (3/7, 43%). During pregnancy, heart failure occurred in 27%. Caesarean section was performed in 63.4% (23.9% as emergency). Therapeutic abortion was performed in 4.0%. Complications included miscarriage (5.6%), fetal mortality (2%), premature delivery (21.7%), low birth weight (19.0%), and neonatal mortality (0.7%). Conclusion: Mortality in this group of patients with various forms of PH was lower than previously reported as specialized care during pregnancy and delivery was available. However, maternal and fetal mortality remains prohibitively high in women with iPAH, although this conclusion is restricted by limited numbers.

The AMP activity of gill and haemocyte extracts was compared at pH 6.0, 7.7 and 8.1, with a radial diffusion assay against Escherichia coli. The activity of the gill extracts was not affected by pH, while it was significantly reduced with increasing pH in the haemocyte extracts. Gill extracts were also tested against different species of Vibrio (V. parahaemolyticus, V. tubiashii, V. splendidus, V. alginolyticus) at pH 7.7 and 8.1. The metabolic activity of the bacteria decreased by ∼65–90%, depending on species of bacteria, but was, as in the radial diffusion assay, not affected by pH. The results indicated that AMPs from gills are efficient in a broad pH-range. However, when mussels were pre-exposed for pH 7.7 for four month the gill extracts presented significantly lower inhibit of bacterial growth. A full in-depth proteome investigation of gill extracts, using LC-Orbitrap MS/MS technique, showed that among previously described AMPs from haemocytes of Mytilus, myticin A was found up-regulated in response to lipopolysaccharide, 3 h post injection. Sporadic occurrence of other immune related peptides/proteins also pointed to a rapid response (0.5–3 h p.i.). Altogether, our results indicate that the gills of blue mussels constitute an important first line defence adapted to act at the pH of seawater. The antimicrobial activity of the gills is however modulated when mussels are under the pressure of ocean acidification, which may give future advantages for invading pathogens.","[""Animals"",""Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides"",""Climate Change"",""Escherichia coli"",""Gills"",""Hemocytes"",""Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"",""Mytilus edulis"",""Proteome"",""Seawater"",""Vibrio""]","[""Antimicrobial peptide"",""Gill tissue"",""LC-Orbitrap MS/MS analysis"",""LPS"",""Mytilus edulis"",""Ocean acidification"",""Proteome analysis"",""Vibrio""]",10.1016/j.fsi.2016.04.007,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975856192,,0

However, along with significant improvements of the hygienic water quality, there is an increasing demand of using the river for recreational purposes, in particular for bathing. In the “Safe Ruhr” interdisciplinary research project, demands, options and chances for lifting the bathing ban for the Ruhr River were investigated. As being the prominent reason for persisting recreational restrictions, microbiological water quality was in the focus of interest. Not only the faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) as required by the European Bathing Water Directive were considered, but also pathogens such as Salmonella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Legionella pneumophila, Campylobacter, Leptospira, enteroviruses and protozoan parasites. In this introductory paper, we firstly relate current recreational desires to historical experiences of river bathing. After recapitulating relevant microbial river contamination sources (predominantly sewage treatment plants, combined sewer overflows, and surface runoffs), we review existing knowledge about the relationships of FIOs and pathogens in rivers designated for recreational purposes, and then trace the evolution, rationale and validity of recreational freshwater quality criteria which are, despite obvious uncertainties, mostly relying on the FIO paradigm. In particular, the representativeness of FIOs is critically discussed. The working programme of Safe Ruhr, aiming at initiating and facilitating a process towards legalisation of Ruhr River bathing, is outlined. Sources of contamination can be technically handled which leaves the actual measures to political decisions. As contaminations are transient, only occasionally exceeding legal limits, a flexible bathing site management, warning bathers of non-safe situations, may amend technical interventions and offer innovative solutions. As a result, a situation-adapted system for lifting of the bathing ban for Ruhr River appears realistic.","[""Cities"",""Cryptosporidium"",""Enterobacteriaceae"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Germany"",""Giardia"",""Industrial Development"",""Recreation"",""Rivers"",""Water Microbiology"",""Water Pollutants"",""Water Quality""]","[""Big jump"",""European bathing water directive"",""Faecal indicator bacteria"",""Pathogenic microorganisms"",""River bathing"",""Safe ruhr""]",10.1016/j.ijheh.2016.07.007,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84993971791,,0

Design: This study is a systematic review of reviews. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and PsychINFO were searched, from inception to December 2013. Eligible reviews addressed causes of the evidence to practice gap in primary care in developed countries. Data from included reviews were extracted and synthesised using guidelines for meta-synthesis. Results: Seventy reviews fulfilled the inclusion criteria and encompassed a wide range of topics, e.g. guideline implementation, integration of new roles, technology implementation, public health and preventative medicine. None of the included papers used the term ""cause"" or stated an intention to investigate causes at all. A descriptive approach was often used, and the included papers expressed ""causes"" in terms of ""barriers and facilitators"" to implementation. We developed a four-level framework covering external context, organisation, professionals and intervention. External contextual factors included policies, incentivisation structures, dominant paradigms, stakeholders' buy-in, infrastructure and advances in technology. Organisation-related factors included culture, available resources, integration with existing processes, relationships, skill mix and staff involvement. At the level of individual professionals, professional role, underlying philosophy of care and competencies were important. Characteristics of the intervention that impacted on implementation included evidence of benefit, ease of use and adaptability to local circumstances. We postulate that the ""fit"" between the intervention and the context is critical in determining the success of implementation. Conclusions: This comprehensive review of reviews summarises current knowledge on the barriers and facilitators to implementation of diverse complex interventions in primary care. To maximise the uptake of complex interventions in primary care, health care professionals and commissioning organisations should consider the range of contextual factors, remaining aware of the dynamic nature of context. Future studies should place an emphasis on describing context and articulating the relationships between the factors identified here.

Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"© 2016 The Author(s).Background: Low back pain is a major clinical and public health problem, with limited evidence-based treatments. Low-dose antidepressants are commonly used to treat pain in chronic low back pain. However, their efficacy is unproven. The aim of this pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial is to determine whether low-dose amitriptyline (an antidepressant) is more effective than placebo in reducing pain in individuals with chronic low back pain. Methods/design: One hundred and fifty individuals with chronic low back pain will be recruited through hospital and private medical and allied health clinics, advertising in local media and posting of flyers in community locations. They will be randomly allocated to receive either low-dose amitriptyline (25 mg) or an active placebo (benztropine mesylate, 1 mg) for 6 months. The primary outcome measure of pain intensity will be assessed at baseline, 3 and 6 months using validated questionnaires. Secondary measures of self-reported low back disability, work absence and hindrance in the performance of paid/unpaid work will also be examined. Intention-to-treat analyses will be performed. Discussion: This pragmatic, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial will provide evidence regarding the effectiveness of low-dose antidepressants compared with placebo in reducing pain, disability, work absenteeism and hindrance in work performance in individuals with chronic low back pain. This trial has major public health and clinical importance as it has the potential to provide an effective approach to the management of chronic low back pain.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Preterm birth is the most common single cause of perinatal and infant mortality, affecting 15 million infants worldwide each year with global rates increasing. Understanding of risk factors remains poor, and preventive interventions have only limited benefit. Large differences exist in preterm birth rates across high income countries. We hypothesized that understanding the basis for these wide variations could lead to interventions that reduce preterm birth incidence in countries with high rates. We thus sought to assess the contributions of known risk factors for both spontaneous and provider-initiated preterm birth in selected high income countries, estimating also the potential impact of successful interventions due to advances in research, policy and public health, or clinical practice. Methods We analyzed individual patient-level data on 4.1 million singleton pregnancies from four countries with very high human development index (Czech Republic, New Zealand, Slovenia, Sweden) and one comparator U.S. state (California) to determine the specific contribution (adjusting for confounding effects) of 21 factors. Both individual and populationattributable preterm birth risks were determined, as were contributors to cross-country differences. We also assessed the ability to predict preterm birth given various sets of known risk factors. Findings Previous preterm birth and preeclampsia were the strongest individual risk factors of preterm birth in all datasets, with odds ratios of 4.6-6.0 and 2.8-5.7, respectively, for individual women having those characteristics. In contrast, on a population basis, nulliparity and male sex were the two risk factors with the highest impact on preterm birth rates, accounting for 25-50% and 11-16% of excess population attributable risk, respectively (p<0.001). The importance of nulliparity and male sex on population attributable risk was driven by high prevalence despite low odds ratios for individual women. More than 65% of the total aggregated risk of preterm birth within each country lacks a plausible biologic explanation, and 63% of difference between countries cannot be explained with known factors; thus, research is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of preterm birth and, hence, therapeutic intervention. Surprisingly, variation in prevalence of known risk factors accounted for less than 35% of the difference in preterm birth rates between countries. Known risk factors had an area under the curve of less than 0.7 in ROC analysis of preterm birth prediction within countries. These data suggest that other influences, as yet unidentified, are involved in preterm birth. Further research into biological mechanisms is warranted. Conclusions We have quantified the causes of variation in preterm birth rates among countries with very high human development index. The paucity of explicit and currently identified factors amenable to intervention illustrates the limited impact of changes possible through current clinical practice and policy interventions. Our research highlights the urgent need for research into underlying biological causes of preterm birth, which alone are likely to lead to innovative and efficacious interventions.","[""California"",""Czech Republic"",""Databases, Factual"",""Developed Countries"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Infant, Newborn"",""Male"",""Multivariate Analysis"",""New Zealand"",""Pregnancy"",""Premature Birth"",""Regression Analysis"",""Risk Factors"",""Slovenia"",""Sweden""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0162506,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990891705,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162506&type=printable,0

Because synaptic structures with high Ca2+ buffering [2–4] or energy demand [5] are often localized far away from the soma, mitochondria are actively transported to these sites [6–11]. Also, the removal and degradation of mitochondria are tightly regulated [9, 12, 13], because dysfunctional mitochondria are a source of reactive oxygen species, which can damage the cell [14]. Deficits in mitochondrial trafficking have been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, optic atrophy, and Alzheimer's disease [13, 15–19]. In neuronal cultures, about a third of mitochondria are motile, whereas the majority remains stationary for several days [8, 20]. Activity-dependent mechanisms cause mitochondria to stop at synaptic sites [7, 8, 20, 21], which affects synapse function and maintenance. Reducing mitochondrial content in dendrites decreases spine density [22, 23], whereas increasing mitochondrial content or activity increases it [7]. These bidirectional interactions between synaptic activity and mitochondrial trafficking suggest that mitochondria may regulate synaptic plasticity. Here we investigated the dynamics of mitochondria in relation to axonal boutons of neocortical pyramidal neurons for the first time in vivo. We find that under these circumstances practically all mitochondria are stationary, both during development and in adulthood. In adult visual cortex, mitochondria are preferentially localized at putative boutons, where they remain for several days. Retinal-lesion-induced cortical plasticity increases turnover of putative boutons but leaves mitochondrial turnover unaffected. We conclude that in visual cortex in vivo, mitochondria are less dynamic than in vitro, and that structural plasticity does not affect mitochondrial dynamics.","[""Animals"",""Female"",""Mice"",""Mice, Inbred C57BL"",""Mitochondrial Dynamics"",""Neuronal Plasticity"",""Presynaptic Terminals"",""Pyramidal Cells"",""Visual Cortex""]",,10.1016/j.cub.2016.07.033,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992208839,http://www.cell.com/article/S0960982216307849/pdf,0

Further increases in human populations, changes in availability and cost of raw materials, policy constraints, price volatility and climatic changes will further drive greater efficiency and high yields in agriculture, with the risk of further adverse environmental impacts. We assess the effects of different management priorities (production-driven cropping vs. wildlife-friendly farming) at an arable farm in eastern England on food production, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and biodiversity. We modelled one actual and three alternative cropping scenarios using actual yields from the farm over 13 years, to calculate total yields and those foregone for agri-environmental measures. We measured crop yields, relative abundance of 19 farmland bird species, and CO2 and N2O emissions related to crop production. Removing up to 10.5% of land from production coupled with a more diverse rotation (including legumes) resulted in a large increase in breeding birds (177%) and reduction of 9.4% in GHG emissions at the cost of 9.6% of food energy. Food protein lost was only 2.9%.

Here, 40 nm silver NP (AgNP) were spiked into a mesocosm simulating the process used at a major municipal WWTP. The evolution of the mass distributions and number concentrations were followed by fast acquisition speed technique single particle inductively coupled mass spectrometry (FAST spICP-MS) using a high-resolution ICP-MS. It was thus possible to detect smaller Ag containing NP than hitherto possible in similar studies. These small particles (ca. 5-10 nm in corresponding metallic Ag equivalent spherical diameter) were possibly dissolved Ag+ precipitated as Ag2S particles. They were detected immediately upon spiking and were stable with respect to aggregation and thus much less removed by the WWTP process compared to the 40 nm AgNP. The results also suggested that any transformation of the latter AgNP occurred without dissolution. Most of these larger AgNP were probably removed by aggregation with large floc particles and subsequent sedimentation with the suspended particulate matter in the simulated WWTP process. The results have implications for differentiating the fate of nanoparticles as a function of size and demonstrate how spICP-MS can reveal such size-dependent fate dynamics.",,,10.1039/c6en00650g,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85022090991,http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/516926/1/N516926PP.pdf,0

Published by Taylor & Francis.ABSTRACT: The activated sludge process is commonly used to treat wastewater by aerobic oxidation of organic pollutants into carbon dioxide and water. However, several nonoxidative mechanisms can also contribute to removal of organics. Sorption onto activated sludge can remove a large fraction of the colloidal and particulate wastewater organics. Intracellular storage of, e.g., polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), triacylglycerides (TAG), or wax esters can convert wastewater organics into precursors for high-value products. Recently, several environmental, economic, and technological drivers have stimulated research on nonoxidative removal of organics for wastewater treatment. In this paper, we review these nonoxidative removal mechanisms as well as the existing and emerging process configurations that make use of them for wastewater treatment. Better utilization of nonoxidative processes in activated sludge could reduce the wasteful aerobic oxidation of organic compounds and lead to more resource-efficient wastewater treatment plants.","[""Activated sludge"",""Aerobic oxidations"",""DLVO theory"",""Poly-hydroxyalkanoate"",""Polyhydroxyalkanoates"",""Process configuration"",""Triacylglyceride"",""Wastewater treatment plants""]","[""Adsorption"",""colloids"",""contact-stabilization"",""DLVO theory"",""high-rate activated sludge"",""polyhydroxyalkanoate"",""triacylglyceride""]",10.1080/10643389.2016.1149903,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964031601,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10643389.2016.1149903?needAccess=true,0

While the real extent and economic impact is hard to quantify, scientists and officials agree that cybercrime is a huge and still growing problem. A substantial fraction of cybercrime's overall costs to society can be traced to indirect opportunity costs, resulting from unused online services. This paper presents a parsimonious model that builds on technology acceptance research and insights from criminology to identify factors that reduce Internet users' intention to use online services. We hypothesize that avoidance of online banking, online shopping and online social networking is increased by cybercrime victimization and media reports. The effects are mediated by the perceived risk of cybercrime and moderated by the user's confidence online. We test our hypotheses using a structural equation modeling analysis of a representative pan-European sample. Our empirical results confirm the negative impact of perceived risk of cybercrime on the use of all three online service categories and support the role of cybercrime experience as an antecedent of perceived risk of cybercrime. We further show that more confident Internet users perceive less cybercriminal risk and are more likely to use online banking and online shopping, which highlights the importance of consumer education.","[""Cybercrime"",""On-line service"",""Perceived risk"",""Structural equation modeling"",""Technology acceptance model""]","[""Consumer Behavior"",""Economics of Cybercrime"",""Online Service Avoidance"",""Perceived Risk"",""Structural Equation Modeling"",""Technology Acceptance Model""]",10.1109/TDSC.2015.2410795,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963718521,,0

However, the implications of phenology to environmental conservation and management remain poorly explored. Here,we present the first explicit appraisal of howphenology-amultidisciplinary science encompassing biometeorology, ecology, and evolutionary biology- can make a key contribution to contemporary conservation biology. We focus on shifts in plant phenology induced by global change, their impacts on species diversity and plant-animal interactions in the tropics, and how conservation efforts could be enhanced in relation to plant resource organization. We identify the effects of phenological changes and mismatches in the maintenance and conservation of mutualistic interactions, and examine how phenological research can contribute to evaluate, manage and mitigate the consequences of land-use change and other natural and anthropogenic disturbances, such as fire, exotic and invasive species. Wealso identify cutting-edge tools that can improve the spatial and temporal coverage of phenological monitoring, from satellites to drones and digital cameras. We highlight the role of historical information in recovering long-term phenological time series, and track climate-related shifts in tropical systems.

All rights reserved.Marine sponges are found to be a wide source of bioactive compounds with different effects such as anti-inflammatory or anticancer actions among others. Cyclophilin A (Cyp A) is a target protein implicated in the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive compounds such as Cyclosporine A (CsA). In the present paper we studied the binding between 4 Spongionella compounds (Gracilins H, A, L and Tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1) and Cyp A immobilized over a CM5 sensor chip. Thus, we found that Spongionella compounds showed to have similar binding affinities than CsA with dissociation equilibrium constant in the range. Next, the effect of these Spongionella isolated compounds was tested over calcineurin phosphatase activity. The same than CsA, Gracilin H, A and Tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1 were able to inhibit phosphatase activity once the complex between Cyp A-CsA/Spongionella compounds was formed. The ability to avoid the dephosphorylation of NFATc1 was also checked in human T cells isolated from peripheral blood. First, cells were pre-treated with Spongionella compounds or CsA following by Concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation. In these conditions nuclear NFATc1 levels were diminished either by CsA or Gracilin A, L, and Tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1 treatment. Moreover, as happens with CsA due to the inhibition of NFATc1, Interleukine-2 (IL-2) released to the culture medium was significantly decreased with all Spongionella compounds. Results conclude that, Spongionella derivatives preserve T lymphocytes from activation modulating the same pathway than CsA. Thus, this mechanism of action suggests that these compounds could be interesting candidates in drug development as immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory drugs.","[""Animals"",""Cell Survival"",""Cells, Cultured"",""Cyclosporine"",""Diterpenes"",""Humans"",""Immunosuppressive Agents"",""Interleukin-2"",""NFATC Transcription Factors"",""Phosphoric Monoester Hydrolases"",""Porifera"",""T-Lymphocytes""]","[""Calcineurin"",""Cyclophilin A"",""IL-2"",""NFATc1"",""Spongionella"",""T lymphocyte""]",10.1016/j.phrs.2016.03.029,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971315349,http://hdl.handle.net/2164/8589,0

Building predictive models that link MC composition to function is a key emerging challenge in microbial ecology.

We discuss specific examples where model-experiment integration has already resulted in important insights into MC function and structure.

In soil remediation experiments, addition of two biochar rates, i.e. 2.5 and 5 mg g−1, strongly reduced Phe extractability (up to 2.7% of the initially added Phe with the larger BC dose). This was similar to the behavior observed when compost was applied in order to verify the role of soil organic matter in the fate of both contaminants.

All rights reserved. Algal toxins may accumulate in fish and shellfish and thus cause poisoning in consumers of seafood. Such toxins and the algae producing them are regularly surveyed in many countries, including Europe, North America, Japan and others. However, very little is known regards the occurrence of such algae and their toxins in most African countries. This paper reports on a survey of phytoplankton and algal toxins in Nigerian coastal waters. Seawater samples were obtained from four sites for phytoplankton identification, on three occasions between the middle of October 2014 and the end of February 2015 (Bar Beach and Lekki in Lagos State, Port Harcourt in Rivers State and Uyo in Akwa Ibom State). The phytoplankton community was generally dominated by diatoms and cyanobacteria; however several species of dinoflagellates were also identified: Dinophysis caudata, Lingulodinium polyedrum and two benthic species of Prorocentrum. Passive samplers (containing Diaion ® HP-20 resin) were deployed for several 1-week periods on the same four sites to obtain profiles of algal toxins present in the seawater. Quantifiable amounts of okadaic acid (OA) and pectenotoxin 2 (PTX2), as well as traces of dinophysistoxin 1 (DTX1) were detected at several sites. Highest concentrations (60 ng OA g -1 HP-20 resin) were found at Lekki and Bar Beach stations, which also had the highest salinities. Non-targeted analysis using full-scan high resolution mass spectrometry showed that algal metabolites differed from site to site and for different sampling occasions. Screening against a marine natural products database indicated the potential presence of cyanobacterial compounds in the water column, which was also consistent with phytoplankton analysis. During this study, the occurrence of the marine dinoflagellate toxins OA and PTX2 has been demonstrated in coastal waters of Nigeria, despite unfavourable environmental conditions, with regards to the low salinities measured. Hence shellfish samples should be monitored in future to assess the risk for public health through accumulation of such toxins in seafood.","[""Chromatography, Liquid"",""Dinoflagellida"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Furans"",""Marine Toxins"",""Mass Spectrometry"",""Nigeria"",""Okadaic Acid"",""Phytoplankton"",""Pyrans""]","[""Dinoflagellates"",""Dinophysis"",""Phycotoxins"",""Phytoplankton"",""Untargeted analysis""]",10.1016/j.toxicon.2016.02.011,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959520120,https://archimer.ifremer.fr/doc/00314/42521/41893.pdf,0

The reproductive biology of P. albomaculatus was studied from samples collected between February 2013 and March 2014. Histological examination confirmed functional gonochoristic sexual reproduction. Sex ratios were biased towards females (4.36:1), and although the size distribution of males and females overlapped, the mean ± SD total length (TL) of males (45.9 ± 8.4 cm) was significantly larger than that of females (41.5 ± 7.6 cm). Length at first maturity for females was 37 cm TL. Monthly gonado-somatic indices and the presence of eggs in the hydrated sub-phase suggest a spawning season between October and March, with a reproductive peak between November and January. Given its restricted range and continuous levels of exploitation, a management plan that includes minimum and maximum landing sizes and a seasonal closure during the reproductive season is urgently required for this Endangered Galapagos endemic.",,"[""Camotillo"",""Galapagos Marine Reserve"",""Management"",""MPA"",""Serranidae"",""Small-scale fisheries""]",10.3354/esr00858,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040347962,https://www.int-res.com/articles/esr2017/34/n034p301.pdf,0

Mean total concentrations (G + P) of PAHs and oxy-PAHs were in the same range and about 10 ng m− 3. Nitro-PAHs were 50 to 100 times less concentrated averaging 100 pg m− 3. Polycyclic aromatic compound (PAC) concentrations were 5 to 7 times higher in “cold” period (October to March) than in “warm” period (April to September). Seasonal variations may be explained by higher primary emissions from residential heating, especially biomass burning in “cold” season. Meteorological conditions and influence of the geomorphology around Grenoble, with the formation of thermal inversion layers leading to the stagnation of pollutants, were additional key parameters. Maximum individual PAC concentrations were observed during two PM10 pollution events in December and February–March. Chemical processes and secondary formation of oxy- and nitro-PAH were probably enhanced by the accumulation of the pollutants during these events. PAC gas/particle partitioning depended on compound molecular weight and vapour pressure. Gas/particle partitioning of oxy- and nitro-PAHs were evaluated using a multi-phase poly-parameter linear free energy relationship model. The PAC cancer risk was assessed using toxic equivalency factors available in the literature (19 PAHs, 10 nitro-PAHs and 1 oxy-PAH). Overall, particle-bound PACs contributed about 76% of the cancer risk. While PAHs accounted for most of the total PAC cancer risk, oxy- and nitro-PAHs could account for up to 24%.

However, little attention has been paid to the question of social exclusion and economic investments in HSR systems. This paper aims to fill this gap by focusing on understanding the reasons why users feel they are socially excluded from these services. A revealed preference survey was carried out using the Google platform, interviewing users of the Italian transport network who were travelling for a variety of purposes, including road (car and bus), rail and HSR. Through the questionnaire, socio-economic data about the travellers have been collected, as well as information about the trip, i.e. its purpose, the transport mode chosen, and the origin and destination. However, in order to understand what prevents travellers from using HSR, factors other than cost have turned out to have an impact. Indeed, a mode choice model has been specified and calibrated, and the main outcome of the analysis is that geographical exclusion, i.e. low accessibility to the arrival/departure HSR station, is a relevant factor inhibiting users from choosing the service.","[""High speed rail"",""Mode choice models"",""Origin and destinations"",""Perceived utility"",""Revealed preference"",""Social exclusion"",""Socio-economic data"",""Transport networks""]","[""Expected maximum perceived utility (EMPU)"",""High-speed rail"",""Mode choice model"",""Social exclusion""]",10.1080/1023697X.2016.1263162,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016447715,,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of The Royal Astronomical Society.Kinematics of divergent boundaries and Rift-Rift-Rift junctions are classically studied using long-termgeodetic observations. Since significant magma-related displacements are expected, short-term deformation provides important constraints on the crustal mechanisms involved both in active rifting and in transfer of extensional deformation between spreading axes. Using InSAR and GPS data, we analyse the surface deformation in the whole Central Afar region in detail, focusing on both the extensional deformation across the Quaternary magmato-tectonic rift segments, and on the zones of deformation transfer between active segments and spreading axes. The largest deformation occurs across the two recently activated Asal-Ghoubbet (AG) and Manda Hararo-Dabbahu (MH-D) magmato-tectonic segments with very high strain rates, whereas the other Quaternary active segments do not concentrate any large strain, suggesting that these rifts are either sealed during interdyking periods or not mature enough to remain a plate boundary. Outside of these segments, the GPS horizontal velocity field shows a regular gradient following a clockwise rotation of the displacements from the Southeast to the East of Afar, with respect to Nubia. Very few shallow creeping structures can be identified as well in the InSAR data. However, using these data together with the strain rate tensor and the rotations rates deduced from GPS baselines, the present-day strain field over Central Afar is consistent with the main tectonic structures, and therefore with the long-term deformation.We investigate the current kinematics of the triple junction included in our GPS data set by building simple block models. The deformation in Central Afar can be described by adding a central microblock evolving separately from the three surrounding plates. In this model, the northern block boundary corresponds to a deep EW-trending trans-tensional dislocation, locked from the surface to 10-13 km and joining at depth the active spreading axes of the Red Sea and the Aden Ridge, from AG to MH-D rift segments. Over the long-term, this plate configuration could explain the presence of the en-échelon magmatic basins and subrifts. However, the transient behaviour of the spreading axes implies that the deformation in Central Afar evolves depending on the availability of magma supply within the well-established segments.","[""Africa"",""Continental tectonics: Extensional"",""Kinematics of crustal and mantle deformations"",""Mid-ocean ridge process"",""Transient deformation""]","[""Africa"",""Continental tectonics: extensional"",""Kinematics of crustal and mantle deformation"",""Mid-ocean ridge processes"",""Transient deformation""]",10.1093/gji/ggw434,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85014382585,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/110228/7/Geophys.%20J.%20Int.-2017-Doubre-936-53.pdf,0

Civil society organisations already play a significant role in the reality of cities, what remains to be explored is the question: what is the role of civil society in the future sustainability of European cities? We first examine the novelty of new forms of civil society organization based on a thorough review of recent case studies of civil society initiatives for sustainable transitions across a diversity of European projects and an extensive literature review. We conceptualize a series of roles that civil society plays and the tensions they entail. We argue that, civil society initiatives can pioneer new social relations and practices therefore be an integral part of urban transformations and can fill the void left by a retreating welfare state, thereby safeguarding and servicing social needs but also backing up such a rolling back of the welfare state. It can act as a hidden innovator—contributing to sustainability but remaining disconnected from the wider society. Assuming each of these roles can have unintended effects, such as being proliferated by political agendas, which endanger its role and social mission, and can be peeled off to serve political agendas resulting in its disempowerment and over-exposure.

With socio-economic change, farming practices have changed and with them the landscape. Over time, food production has been increasingly decoupled from the preservation of permanent grassland, endangering the delivery of crucial ecosystem services. This contribution looks into the role of institutions - including normative, regulative and cultural-cognitive elements - in preserving current bundles of ecosystem services provided by mountain grasslands. In particular, we investigate how such institutions affect farmers' management choices. Based on a review of scientific literature and empirical data from three case studies, we compare institutions in Austria, France and Norway. The cases represent different modes of multi-level governance (EU and non-EU), different grassland management practices, linked to different farming systems (dairy, breeding, rearing of heifers, suckler cow and sheep production) and different socio-economic conditions. The results underpin that ecological insights into the impact of farming practices on the ecology of grassland need to be combined with an understanding of the complex institutional interactions that affect farming practices, to ensure the resilience of mountain grasslands. If the design of regulatory measures considers both changing dynamics, it may enable farms to adapt and transform while maintaining traditional grassland management practices.",,"[""Farm management practices"",""Institutions"",""Marginal mountain grasslands"",""Socio-ecological resilience""]",10.1016/j.landusepol.2015.12.009,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960389684,https://diglib.uibk.ac.at/ulbtirolfodok/content/titleinfo/2344781/full.pdf,0

All rights reserved.Thermal energy storage is an attractive option for effectiveness in many applications such as concentrated solar thermal power or district heating network, since it gives flexibility and reduces energy consumption and costs. The objectives of the present study are to assess copper foam interest as thermal conductivity enhancement technique for latent heat thermal energy storage and to compare copper foam with other heat transfer enhancement systems for shell-and-tubes heat exchangers. The best heat transfer fluid injection side is sought for charge and discharge. Besides, a method is proposed to estimate the characteristic time for melting/solidification and enable comparison between various tests conditions and heat exchanger geometries. In this paper, a copper foam is implemented in a shell-and-tube heat exchanger as phase change thermal energy storage unit and studied experimentally. Visualization enables the melting/solidification front to be seen, followed and recorded. Bottom and top injection for charge and discharge are compared, vertically and horizontally. It appears that vertical charge and discharge are faster than horizontal ones and that top charge and discharge are faster than bottom ones, thus assessing the significance of volume expansion and natural convection for heat transfer in the phase change material. Moreover, the tested copper foam enhanced geometry is compared with other heat exchangers such as finned copper tube, tube surrounded by carbon foam and a simple tube. It is shown that copper foam combines low-density with high heat transfer performance since it is as efficient as copper fins with half the copper mass, and far more efficient than other presented heat exchangers. Besides, a method for estimating solidification and melting time is proposed. Based on a thermocouple network, this method rests upon measured temperatures inside the phase change material.","[""Concentrated solar thermal power"",""Copper foam"",""Energy consumption and cost"",""Experimental"",""Latent heat thermal energy storage"",""Shell and tube heat exchangers"",""Solidification and melting"",""Thermal conductivity enhancement""]","[""Copper foam"",""Experimental"",""Injection side"",""Phase change material"",""Thermal energy storage"",""Visualization""]",10.1016/j.applthermaleng.2016.02.095,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027925756,,0

Here we re-evaluate what makes problems wicked and assess various theoretical and pragmatic approaches that have been advanced to tackle them. We do so with the aim of contributing new insights to theory through answering the following research questions: What strategies to tackle wicked environmental problems are prominent in the literature?; To what extent do they provide pathways for tackling the defining characteristics of wicked environmental problems?; and, How are these strategies reflected in examples of practice? Our examples look at how emergent strategies have percolated, explicitly or implicitly, in the management of four problems in Scotland: (1) Securing sustainability and resilience of landscape and land-use systems through spatial planning; (2) Addressing population health through livestock disease control; (3) Mitigating climate change through woodland planting; and, (4) Mitigating rural diffuse pollution in freshwater systems. We present a consolidated set of characteristics of wicked problems against which we map strategies to tackle wicked problems proposed by a body of literature identified through a literature review and analysed using a thematic, qualitative approach. We identify fifteen strategies and show that most of these are, within the Scottish context, evident in practice.

Versteegh 2017.Civil society is widely commended for its contribution to the functioning of society at large. In both the scientific literature and policy documents published by international institutions, civil society is cited as an important partner in shaping public policy and making a significant positive contribution to the functioning of public administration as well as to helping create a sense of community and ‘pluriformity’. Civil society plays a major role in the provision of elementary services (education, health, social services, housing, development aid etc.), but it also functions as a carrier for inter alia artistic, social and idealistic expression, sports and recreation, advocacy and social cohesion. Ultimately, civil society is considered beneficial, if not indispensable, in the development and maintaining of a healthy democratic society. Although the concept of civil society is used widely, there does not seem to be one generally accepted definition of the term. By some definitions, the term ‘civil society’ is used to refer to a society that is based on a recognition of the rule of law and of democratic principles and human rights. Generally, however, civil society is understood to be constituted by informal groups and formal organisations that citizens are free to choose to join or not. In this respect, civil society is distinct from family and the state. In addition to its voluntary character, civil society is commonly considered to contribute to objectives that are non-commercial in nature. This latter characteristic sets it apart from businesses, which aim to make a profit and distribute these profits to their members or shareholders. In this volume, we adopt this latter concept of civil society. Characteristics such as adhering to the rule of law and democratic principles in this approach do not constitute civil society, even if they are a precondition for developing and maintaining a healthy civil society. When viewed in this way, civil society is generally seen as the third major component in the fabric of society, alongside the state and the market. It is the area in which collective social goals are identified and pursued and that provides an infrastructure for the representation of citizens. Civil society organisations (CSOs) play an important role as intermediaries between citizens, on the one hand, and the state and the market on the other.",,,10.1017/9781316536407.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047896001,,0

Acidification of the surface oceans due to absorption of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is an additional stressor facing the pelagic community of the already challenging Baltic Sea. To investigate its impact on trace gas biogeochemistry, a largescale mesocosm experiment was performed off Tvärminne Research Station, Finland, in summer 2012. During the second half of the experiment, dimethylsulfide (DMS) concentrations in the highest-fCO2 mesocosms (1075-1333 μatm) were 34% lower than at ambient CO2 (350 μatm). However, the net production (as measured by concentration change) of seven halocarbons analysed was not significantly affected by even the highest CO2 levels after 5 weeks' exposure. Methyl iodide (CH3I) and diiodomethane (CH2I2) showed 15 and 57% increases in mean mesocosm concentration (3.8±0.6 increasing to 4.3±0.4 pmol L-1 and 87.4±14.9 increasing to 134.4±24.1 pmol L-1 respectively) during Phase II of the experiment, which were unrelated to CO2 and corresponded to 30% lower Chl a concentrations compared to Phase I. No other iodocarbons increased or showed a peak, with mean chloroiodomethane (CH2ClI) concentrations measured at 5.3 (±0.9) pmol L-1 and iodoethane (C2H5I) at 0.5 (±0.1) pmol L-1. Of the concentrations of bromoform (CHBr3; mean 88.1±13.2 pmol L-1), dibromomethane (CH2Br2; mean 5.3±0.8 pmol L-1), and dibromochloromethane (CHBr2Cl, mean 3.0±0.5 pmol L-1), only CH2Br2 showed a decrease of 17% between Phases I and II, with CHBr3 and CHBr2Cl showing similar mean concentrations in both phases. Outside the mesocosms, an upwelling event was responsible for bringing colder, high-CO2, low-pH water to the surface starting on day t16 of the experiment; this variable CO2 system with frequent upwelling events implies that the community of the Baltic Sea is acclimated to regular significant declines in pH caused by up to 800 μatm fCO2. After this upwelling, DMS concentrations declined, but halocarbon concentrations remained similar or increased compared to measurements prior to the change in conditions. Based on our findings, with future acidification of Baltic Sea waters, biogenic halocarbon emissions are likely to remain at similar values to today; however, emissions of biogenic sulfur could significantly decrease in this region.",,,10.5194/bg-13-4595-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982103105,https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/4595/2016/bg-13-4595-2016.pdf,0

Over time, using it for recreational purposes became a serious health hazard and bathing was banned due to chemical and microbiological risks. The purpose of the collaborative project “Safe Ruhr” was to verify the current status and to provide a scientific basis for lifting the bathing ban. As the river also provides a raw water source for drinking water production, it was investigated how well the treatment procedures control possible hygienic risks. As study area, the barrier Lake Baldeney was chosen as it embraces earlier bathing sites and tributes to river bank filtration water for drinking water treatment plants. The hygienic condition of the river water was determined over 18 months by measuring general physical, chemical and microbiological water quality parameters including fecal indicators, bacterial obligate and facultative pathogens, parasitic protozoa, enteric viruses and schistosome parasites (Trichobilharzia). Samples were taken at eight locations including sites before and after receiving the discharge of stormwater and treated wastewater, potential future bathing sites and a raw water abstraction point for potable water production. In summary, for all investigated physico-chemical parameters no significant difference between the eight investigated sampling locations on a distinct sampling date were observed. This study focused on hygienically relevant bacteria and parasitic protozoa. Fecal indicators, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens as well as coliform bacteria were detected in 94–100% of the water samples. Enteric pathogens, including Campylobacter spp. and Salmonella enterica, were isolated from 33% and 28% of the samples, respectively, in relatively low concentrations. Among the environmental facultative pathogens, P. aeruginosa was detected at a high frequency of 82% of all samples, but in low numbers, while Aeromonas spp. were found in all water samples in relative high concentrations. The levels of all target organisms were not clearly associated with sources of pollution, with the exception of slightly enhanced numbers of coliform bacteria and E. coli downstream of a sewage discharge point from a wastewater treatment plant. Seasonal variations were observed with higher detection rates of Campylobacter spp. in winter and S. enterica in autumn and winter in contrast to the other bacterial groups, which showed no significant fluctuations throughout the year. Precipitation within two days prior to sampling resulted in a trend of enhanced numbers of coliform bacteria, E. coli, intestinal enterococci and Aeromonas. Sampling and analysis of parasitic protozoa was carried out in accordance to the European bathing water guideline and the ISO 15553 method. Characteristics of the river (flow, vegetation, birds protection zone, bathing of people, sewage etc.) were compared to the number of organisms detected. All in all 184 samples were investigated for Cryptosporidium spp. and Giardia spp. 80% of the samples were positive for Giardia spp. with a mean of 5 cysts/100 l (0.1–157.9). Highest values were achieved in autumn and winter, lowest values during the assumed bathing season. There seemed to be a trend to lower values in and after a reservoir in the river course, but with no statistical significance. A statistical significance could be shown for higher concentrations after heavy rainfall that led to discharge of combined sewage overflows in the city of Essen. Only 29% of the samples were positive for Cryptosporidium spp. with a single maximum value of 27.7 and all other concentrations below 5 oocysts/100 l. On a low level there seemed to be slightly higher findings during summer and bathing season than in autumn and winter. No correlation to heavy rainfall could be found. The findings correspond to earlier results from the River Rhine (Germany). The influence of sewage on the water quality of the Ruhr could be shown from the correlation of Giardia load and activity of combined sewage overflows after heavy rainfall. The rare and low findings of Cryptosporidium spp. lead to the same conclusion, that microbial water quality in the investigation area is rather influenced from sewage water than from diffuse water sources into the River Ruhr.","[""Drinking Water"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Feces"",""Germany"",""Recreation"",""Rivers"",""Water Microbiology"",""Water Quality""]","[""Bacterial pathogens"",""Fecal indicators"",""Parasitic protozoa"",""Raw water"",""Recreational water"",""River Ruhr""]",10.1016/j.ijheh.2016.07.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994029404,,0

The biocontrol Agrobacterium radiobacter K84 secretes the Trojan Horse antibiotic agrocin 84 that is selectively transported into the plant pathogen A. tumefaciens and processed into the toxin TM84. We previously showed that TM84 employs a unique tRNA-dependent mechanism to inhibit leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), while the TM84-producer prevents self-poisoning by expressing a resistant LeuRS AgnB2. We now identify a mechanism by which the antibiotic-producing microbe resists its own toxin. Using a combination of structural, biochemical and biophysical approaches, we show that AgnB2 evolved structural changes so as to resist the antibiotic by eliminating the tRNA-dependence of TM84 binding. Mutagenesis of key resistance determinants results in mutants adopting an antibiotic-sensitive phenotype.

The heat transfer and the dry-out behaviour are investigated in a grooved heat pipe model, increasing the power supplied at the evaporator section with an electric cartridge heater and cooling the condenser section with a water loop. The experimental configuration includes a top transparent window and a lighting system with diffused light, enabling visualization of the liquid in the groove with a CCD camera. Self-rewetting fluid behaviour is compared with ordinary heat transfer liquids, including an environmentally sustainable engineered liquid, Novec™ 7100 (Methoxy-nonafluorobutane), and bi-distilled water. Experiments with ethanol, butanol and a water/ethanol mixture have been also carried out to compare self-rewetting fluids with ordinary liquids and binary solution having no minimum in surface tension. It is found that the heat pipe filled with Novec™ exhibits good heat transfer performances at relatively low input power and temperatures, before the evaporator begins to dry. Similar behaviour is observed when ethanol is considered. For the heat pipe filled with water the evaporator becomes completely dry at larger power (40 W). At the same input power, in the case of the self-rewetting fluid, the liquid is strongly flowing from the cold to the hot region due to the inverse Marangoni effect and this beneficially, rewets the evaporator. This phenomenon is never observed when dry out is established with other working fluids. Numerical simulations are carried out to explain some experimental results in case of pure liquid. A possible explanation of rewetting in the case of water/butanol mixture is given.","[""Dry-out"",""Fundamental physics"",""Heat transfer performance"",""Marangoni flows"",""Self-rewetting fluids"",""Two-phase flow heat transfer"",""Visualization and analysis"",""Water/ethanol mixtures""]","[""Dry-out"",""Heat pipe"",""Marangoni flow"",""Self-rewetting fluids""]",10.1016/j.ijheatmasstransfer.2017.07.090,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85025611416,,0

A harmonised meta-analysis of data from more than 1 million men and women","© 2016 Elsevier LtdBackground High amounts of sedentary behaviour have been associated with increased risks of several chronic conditions and mortality. However, it is unclear whether physical activity attenuates or even eliminates the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting. We examined the associations of sedentary behaviour and physical activity with all-cause mortality. Methods We did a systematic review, searching six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, Sport Discus, and Scopus) from database inception until October, 2015, for prospective cohort studies that had individual level exposure and outcome data, provided data on both daily sitting or TV-viewing time and physical activity, and reported effect estimates for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, or breast, colon, and colorectal cancer mortality. We included data from 16 studies, of which 14 were identified through a systematic review and two were additional unpublished studies where pertinent data were available. All study data were analysed according to a harmonised protocol, which categorised reported daily sitting time and TV-viewing time into four standardised groups each, and physical activity into quartiles (in metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-hours per week). We then combined data across all studies to analyse the association of daily sitting time and physical activity with all-cause mortality, and estimated summary hazard ratios using Cox regression. We repeated these analyses using TV-viewing time instead of daily sitting time. Findings Of the 16 studies included in the meta-analysis, 13 studies provided data on sitting time and all-cause mortality. These studies included 1 005 791 individuals who were followed up for 2–18·1 years, during which 84 609 (8·4%) died. Compared with the referent group (ie, those sitting <4 h/day and in the most active quartile [>35·5 MET-h per week]), mortality rates during follow-up were 12–59% higher in the two lowest quartiles of physical activity (from HR=1·12, 95% CI 1·08–1·16, for the second lowest quartile of physical activity [<16 MET-h per week] and sitting <4 h/day; to HR=1·59, 1·52–1·66, for the lowest quartile of physical activity [<2·5 MET-h per week] and sitting >8 h/day). Daily sitting time was not associated with increased all-cause mortality in those in the most active quartile of physical activity. Compared with the referent (<4 h of sitting per day and highest quartile of physical activity [>35·5 MET-h per week]), there was no increased risk of mortality during follow-up in those who sat for more than 8 h/day but who also reported >35·5 MET-h per week of activity (HR=1·04; 95% CI 0·99–1·10). By contrast, those who sat the least (<4 h/day) and were in the lowest activity quartile (<2·5 MET-h per week) had a significantly increased risk of dying during follow-up (HR=1·27, 95% CI 1·22–1·31). Six studies had data on TV-viewing time (N=465 450; 43 740 deaths). Watching TV for 3 h or more per day was associated with increased mortality regardless of physical activity, except in the most active quartile, where mortality was significantly increased only in people who watched TV for 5 h/day or more (HR=1·16, 1·05–1·28). Interpretation High levels of moderate intensity physical activity (ie, about 60–75 min per day) seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time. However, this high activity level attenuates, but does not eliminate the increased risk associated with high TV-viewing time. These results provide further evidence on the benefits of physical activity, particularly in societies where increasing numbers of people have to sit for long hours for work and may also inform future public health recommendations.

The analysis is based on quantitative data from surveys of actors of eight protected areas in northern Norway. The surveys were undertaken just before a change to co-management in 2010. The results show that the two strongest determinants that explain actors’ initial support of the governance change as a means to alleviate conflict are (i) the relationship of actors to the protected areas in terms of knowledge of the protected areas and mental models on conservation and (ii) the economic relevance of the areas for them. Traditionally, other sociocultural variables such as indigenous background (Sámi), age, and gender have been considered relevant and were also identified as significant attributes that define preferences for conservation management alternatives.

All rights reserved.Biogenic carbon is defined as carbon contained in biomass that is accumulated during plant growth. In spite of the considerable progress towards the inventory of biogenic carbon in the life cycle assessment (LCA) of bioenergy in policy guidelines, many scientific articles tend to give no consideration to biogenic carbon, due to the neutrality assumption, rather than to employ a complete inventory according to the LCA principles. Meanwhile, the assumption of biogenic carbon neutrality has been previously challenged on the basis of changes in soil carbon stock due to land use change and carbon storage capacities of long-rotation trees or wood products. Supporting this argument, we investigate three other inventory aspects which strongly affect final results, namely, differences in framing system boundaries (cradle to grave vs. cradle to gate), forms of carbon emissions (carbon dioxide vs. methane), and valuation of biogenic carbon (relative economic values of biomass products vs. biomass residues). Referring to a generic bioenergy system, our analysis is focused on eight scenarios of various carbon flows encompassing biomass decomposition in fields and its alternative utilization as bioenergy feedstocks. These scenarios are applicable to both biomass products and biomass residues, for which the impacts proportionally depend on the chosen allocation criteria between the two. Further, a framework to quantify the performances of the various possible carbon flows on global warming impacts is formulated. The operation of the framework demonstrates that the assumption of biogenic carbon neutrality introduces a bias to the 'true' values based on a complete inventory. This can make the values of global warming impacts substantially higher or lower than the real scores when different system boundaries, forms of carbon emissions, and biomass valuation are taken into account. The results of this study could contribute to the harmonization of future bioenergy LCA by directing further research to adopt more the concept of utilizing a complete inventory rather than the neutrality assumption.","[""Biomass residue"",""Carbon neutralities"",""Global warming impact"",""Life Cycle Inventory"",""System boundary""]","[""Biogenic carbon neutrality"",""Biomass residues"",""Biomass valuation"",""Global warming impact"",""Life cycle inventory"",""System boundary""]",10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.03.096,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963576859,,0

The traditional high-loading ruthenium-on-carbon catalyst (5 wt% Ru) employed for this transformation suffers from low metal utilisation and poor resistance to deactivation due to the formation of RuOx species. Aiming at an improved catalyst design, we have prepared ruthenium nanoparticles modified with the water-soluble hexadecyl(2-hydroxyethyl)dimethylammonium dihydrogen phosphate (HHDMA) ligand and supported on TiSi2O6. The hybrid catalyst has been characterised by ICP-OES, elemental analysis, TGA, DRIFTS, H2-TPR, STEM, EDX, 31P and 13C MAS-NMR, and XPS. When evaluated in the continuous-flow hydrogenation of LA, the Ru-HHDMA/TiSi2O6 catalyst (0.24 wt% Ru) displays a fourfold higher reaction rate than the state-of-the-art Ru/C catalyst, while maintaining 100% selectivity to GVL and no sign of deactivation after 15 hours on stream. An in-depth molecular analysis by Density Functional Theory demonstrates that the intrinsic acidic properties at the ligand-metal interface under reaction conditions ensure that the less energy demanding path is followed. The reaction does not obey the expected cascade mechanism and intercalates hydrogenation steps, hydroxyl/water eliminations, and ring closings to ensure high selectivity. Moreover, the interfacial acidity increases the robustness of the material against ruthenium oxide formation. These results provide valuable improvements for the sustainable production of GLV and insights for the rationalisation of the exceptional selectivity of Ru-based catalysts.",,,10.1039/c6gc02586b,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021831261,https://recercat.cat//bitstream/2072/359760/1/c6gc02586b.pdf,0

However, there are further considerations in violent contexts, where refusal of bribes may have dire consequences. Yet, insight into this topic is limited. This article investigates how violence upholds bribery, through interviews with South African officials who enforce regulations in communities where gangs operate. The investigation shows that when citizens offer bribes to enable rule violations, this is a process of both temptation and threats: officials who refuse bribes face intimidation by both citizens and colluding colleagues. This illustrates how violence may function as a mechanism to enforce corrupt contracts between bureaucrats and criminal citizens. Through reducing costs in such settings, bribe-taking is partly a strategy of social protection. This has implications for policy and suggests that, besides incentives and expectations, administrative reforms may benefit from ‘fixing the security’ of bureaucrats in violent contexts.",,,10.1111/padm.12242,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958211531,,0

All rights reserved.Fisheries acoustics surveys are effective tools in marine resource assessment and marine ecology. Significant advances have occurred in recent years with the application of multiple and broadband frequencies to enable remote species identification. There is, however, still the need to obtain additional evidence for identification, and the estimation of the size and tilt angle distribution of fish, which influences their acoustic target strength. The former two requirements are usually met by obtaining simultaneous net samples: there are limited, if any, recognized successful techniques for the latter. Here, two alternative tools for obtaining evidence for all three requirements are examined: angling gear and small video cameras. These tools were deployed during surveys of Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus). In 2014, angling was actually more efficient than pelagic trawling (the standard technique) and over two survey periods (2012 and 2014) provided length frequency distributions that were not significantly different. A small video camera was deployed into mackerel schools, providing species identification and fish orientation. Image analysis was then applied, producing tilt-angle distributions of free swimming wild mackerel for the first time. Mean tilt angles from three deployments were very variable with 95% of observations falling between -70° and 39° with evidence of a multinomial frequency distribution. A video equipped lander was also deployed onto the type of rocky seabed where deployment of a trawl would be impossible: this confirmed the presence of Norway pout and suggested it was the dominant scatterer on this type of seabed. These techniques are complementary to traditional trawling methods, but provide additional insights into fish behaviour whilst satisfying standard requirements of identification and supplying biological samples. Crucially, the small cameras deployed approximate the size of the animals under observation and allow for measurement of behaviour (specifically tilt) that are more likely to represent those conditions encountered during surveying.",,"[""acoustic surveys"",""ground truth"",""mackerel"",""rod and line"",""tilt angle"",""video""]",10.1093/icesjms/fsw091,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990931750,https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/73/8/2009/31231057/fsw091.pdf,0

By combining results from semi-structured interviews with small-scale fishers and a bioeconomic model, we found that the percentage of discards for small-scale fisheries is usually low, which is consistent with general empirical observations globally but can be high when quotas are exhausted. Our results also confirm that the landing obligation would generate negative impacts on fishers' activities by investing more time on-board to handle previously discarded fishes, and putting at risk the security of fishers at sea due to full use of allowable storage on-board coupled with often adverse sea conditions in Galician bays. The application of the landing obligation policy to small-scale fisheries would result in short- and long-term losses of fishing days and yields, with high negative impacts on sustainable fisheries such as the Galician multispecies small-scale gillnet fishery. The expected number of fishing days under the landing obligation is estimated to be reduced by 50% during the five years following the implementation of the policy.

We sought to develop and validate a model of clinical characteristics to predict 6-month mortality in IE. Methods and Results-Using a large multinational prospective registry of definite IE (International Collaboration on Endocarditis [ICE]-Prospective Cohort Study [PCS], 2000-2006, n=4049), a model to predict 6-month survival was developed by Cox proportional hazards modeling with inverse probability weighting for surgery treatment and was internally validated by the bootstrapping method. This model was externally validated in an independent prospective registry (ICE-PLUS, 2008-2012, n=1197). The 6-month mortality was 971 of 4049 (24.0%) in the ICE-PCS cohort and 342 of 1197 (28.6%) in the ICE-PLUS cohort. Surgery during the index hospitalization was performed in 48.1% and 54.0% of the cohorts, respectively. In the derivation model, variables related to host factors (age, dialysis), IE characteristics (prosthetic or nosocomial IE, causative organism, left-sided valve vegetation), and IE complications (severe heart failure, stroke, paravalvular complication, and persistent bacteremia) were independently associated with 6-month mortality, and surgery was associated with a lower risk of mortality (Harrell's C statistic 0.715). In the validation model, these variables had similar hazard ratios (Harrell's C statistic 0.682), with a similar, independent benefit of surgery (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.89). A simplified risk model was developed by weight adjustment of these variables. Conclusions-Six-month mortality after IE is 25% and is predicted by host factors, IE characteristics, and IE complications. Surgery during the index hospitalization is associated with lower mortality but is performed less frequently in the highest risk patients. A simplified risk model may be used to identify specific risk subgroups in IE.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Endocarditis"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Kaplan-Meier Estimate"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Models, Statistical"",""Propensity Score"",""Registries"",""Reproducibility of Results"",""Risk Assessment"",""Risk Factors"",""Sensitivity and Specificity""]","[""Infection"",""Mortality"",""Prognosis"",""Surgery"",""Valves""]",10.1161/JAHA.115.003016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995655527,https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1161/JAHA.115.003016,0

The aim of the present work was to assess the impact of organic farming, compared to conventional cultivation, on agro-ecosystem functions and soil microbial communities. Two farms that practiced organic cultivation for 10 and 20 years were compared with one conventional farm, all with cultivations under plastic tunnel. Soil functions were assessed with multi-species bioassays on plant growth and organic matter decomposition, and microbial communities were characterized by high-throughput sequencing of bacterial and eukaryotic rRNA gene markers. Plant growth and organic matter decomposition were higher in organic compared to conventionally management soils. Agronomical practices showed a significant effect on microbial diversity and composition. Soil bacterial diversity was lower in both organic farms than in the conventional farm. Soil eukaryotic diversity was slightly higher in the 10-year organic farm but lower in the 20-year organic farm compared to the conventional farm. At phylum level, Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, and TM7 were higher, while Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Actinobacteria were lower in organic-farmed soils compared to conventional farm. Noteworthy, Metazoa raised from 0.1% of eukarya relative abundance in conventional-farmed to 20.9% in 20 year organic-farmed soil. Correlation analysis between microbial OTUs relative abundance and ecosystem functions suggest that eukarya play a major role, compared to bacteria, in controlling plant growth and organic carbon cycling. Integration of microbial diversity data with plant growth and decomposition of organic matter decomposition allowed us to provide a linkage between agricultural management, microbial community composition, and soil functionality.","[""Beneficial microbes"",""Crop yield"",""Earthworms"",""Soil microbiota"",""Soil organic carbon"",""Soil-borne pathogens""]","[""Beneficial microbes"",""Crop yield"",""Earthworms"",""Soil microbiota"",""Soil organic carbon"",""Soilborne pathogens""]",10.1016/j.soilbio.2016.09.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988476555,,0

However, biogeographical shifts in copepod assemblages and colonization of certain European estuaries by the invader A. tonsa, both driven or enhanced by increasing ocean temperature, raise the pressure on autochthonous copepod communities. Despite the profound effect of temperature on all levels of biological organization, its impact on the fatty acid (FA) dynamics of Acartia species is understudied. As certain FAs exert a bottom-up control on the trophic structure of aquatic ecosystems, temperature-induced changes in FA dynamics of Acartia species may impact higher trophic levels. Therefore, this study documents the short-term temperature responses of A. tonsa and A. clausi, characterized by their warm- versus cold-water preference respectively, by analyzing the FA profiles of their membrane and storage lipids under 5 and 15 °C. Copepods that were fed an ad libitum diet of the diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii (bloom conditions) under 15 °C increased their storage FA content substantially. Furthermore, the membrane FA composition of A. tonsa showed a more profound temperature response compared with A. clausi which might be linked with the eurythermal character of the former.",,"[""Acartia sp."",""Fatty acids"",""Lipids"",""Membrane"",""Storage"",""Temperature""]",10.1016/j.seares.2016.03.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973167170,,0

Older adults are particularly at risk. The intervention research on health literacy in ageing populations project systematically created a large inventory of HL interventions targeting adults age 50+, to support practical production of policy and practice guidelines for promoting health literacy in European populations. Methods: We comprehensively surveyed international scientific literature, grey literature and other sources (published 2003+) for implemented HL interventions that involved older adults. Studies were screened for eligibility criteria and further selected for aspects important in European public health policy, including priority diseases, risk factors and vulnerable target groups. Interventions were prioritised using a multiple criteria tool to select final interventions that also featured strong evidence of efficacy and a broad range of strategies. Results: From nearly 7000 written summaries, 1097 met inclusion criteria, of which 233 were chosen for scoring and ranking. Of these, seven had the highest multi-criteria scores. Eight more articles were selected based on rounded criteria including a high multi-criteria score as well as elements of innovation. Final selections were 18 articles describing 15 programmes, which feature strong evidence of efficacy among important diseases or risk factors and vulnerable groups, or that had success with elements of innovation were identified. Most programmes tried to increase skills in communication, self-management and understanding healthcare or lifestyle choices. Conclusions: These programmes have multiple positive attributes which could be used as guidance for developing innovative intervention programmes to trial on European older adults. They provide evidence of efficacy in addressing high priority diseases and risk factors.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aging"",""Europe"",""Health Literacy"",""Health Priorities"",""Humans"",""Middle Aged""]","[""Health literacy"",""Multi-criteria decision aid"",""Older adults"",""Prioritisation exercise""]",10.1186/s13104-016-2056-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971229321,https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13104-016-2056-9,0

There is little consensus on how the features of an independent and meritocratic bureaucracy should be measured across countries, however, and broad empirical studies are therefore rare. What is more, the few such studies that exist have advanced measures which are constructed exclusively on expert surveys. Although these have indeed contributed to the knowledge in the field, the data on which they are built come with problems. This paper proposes a set of novel measures that complement existing measures and thus fill important gaps in this burgeoning literature. The measures we present are not based on expert assessments but on perceptions of public sector employees’ and citizens’. We create two measures—that can be combined into one—from a recent survey (2013) of over 85,000 citizens in 24 European countries. One is purely based on the assessments from public sector employees’ and the other is based on perceptions of citizens working outside the public sector. The paper also discusses the survey and explores the external validity of the measures provided here, showing correlations with alternative measures based on expert opinions, as well as variables from the literature that we would expect to correlate highly with a meritocratic bureaucracy.",,"[""Bureaucracy"",""Corruption"",""Europe"",""Meritocracy"",""Sub national""]",10.1007/s10610-016-9307-0,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962030766,https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/39867/1/gupea_2077_39867_1.pdf,0

Several techniques have been proposed for the treatment of this effluent, but only a few processes have been applied at pilot or industrial scale and, nowadays, the management of olive oil mill wastewaters represents an environmental problem in the olive oil-producing countries. Tests were carried out at pilot scale, by means of a plant with 1 m3 h−1 capacity; a process for the treatment and valorisation of olive mill wastewaters was reported. By this process, it was possible to produce starting from olive mill wastewaters resulting from a three-phase milling system, 62% of purified water, which could be reused in the industrial processes, and a concentrated phenolic extract (9.5% total phenols), which could be used in food, cosmetic or animal feed industry.","[""Animal feed industry"",""Biophenols"",""Environmental problems"",""Industrial processs"",""Oil producing countries"",""Olive mill wastewaters"",""Olive oil mill wastewaters"",""Technical difficulties""]","[""Antioxidant"",""biophenols"",""by-products"",""olive oil mill wastewaters"",""recycling""]",10.1111/ijfs.13219,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979747693,,0

All rights reserved.Poly-chemotherapy plus rituximab followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (auto-SCT) is standard care for untreated young patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Despite this intensive treatment, transplant patients remain highly susceptible to relapse over time. The French SFGM-TC performed a national survey on reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC-allo-SCT) for fit relapsed/refractory patients who failed after auto-SCT (n=106). Median times of relapse after auto-SCT, and from auto-SCT to RIC-allo-SCT were 28 months and 3.6 years, respectively. Sixty per cent of patients received at least three lines of treatment before RIC-allo-SCT. Conditioning regimens for RIC-allo-SCT were heterogeneous. Twenty patients experienced grade III/IV aGvHD, extensive cGvHD was reported in 28 cases. Median follow-up after RIC-allo-SCT was 45 months. Median PFS after RIC-allo-SCT was 30.1 months and median overall survival was 62 months. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 1 year and 3 years were estimated at 28% and 32%, respectively. A total of 52 patients died; major causes of death were related to toxicity (n=34) and MCL (n=11). Patients in good response before RIC-allo-SCT experienced a better PFS and OS.

Methods A regional population-based cohort study of women diagnosed with primary ovarian and fallopian tube cancers and included in the Swedish Quality Registry (SQR) during 2008–2013 in a region where primary care of advanced stages was centralized in 2011. Surgical, oncological characteristics, outcomes, follow-ups and relative survivals were analyzed. Results There were 817 women diagnosed with ovarian and fallopian tube cancers during 2008–2013 and 523 were classified as FIGO stage III-IV and further analyzed. Primary debulking surgery (PDS) was performed in 81% and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) followed by interval debulking surgery (IDS) in 11%. Complete cytoreduction at PDS was performed in 37% before compared to 49% after centralization (p < 0.03). The chemotherapy protocols were identical in the cohorts and they received and completed the planned chemotherapy equally. The time interval between PDS and chemotherapy was 36 days (median) before compared to 24 days after centralization (p < 0.01). The relative 3-year survival rate in women treated by PDS was 44% compared to 65% after centralization and the estimated excess mortality rate ratio (EMRR) was reduced (RR 0.58; 95% CI 0.42–0.79). Comparing the complete cohorts before and after centralization, regardless primary treatment, the relative 3-year survival rate increased from 40% to 61% with reduced EMRR (RR 0.59; 95% CI 0.45–0.76).

Due to its versatile ecology and synurbic habits, Kuhl's pipistrelle (Pipistrellus kuhlii) offers a unique opportunity to explore the relative effects of climate change and urbanisation on species distributions. In a climate change scenario, this typically Mediterranean species is expected to expand its range in response to increasing temperatures. We collected 25,132 high-resolution occurrence records from P. kuhlii European range between 1980 and 2013 and modelled the species' distribution with a multi-temporal approach, using three bioclimatic variables and one proxy of urbanisation. Temperature in the coldest quarter of the year was the most important factor predicting the presence of P. kuhlii and showed an increasing trend in the study period; mean annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality were also relevant, but to a lower extent. Although urbanisation increased in recently colonised areas, it had little effect on the species' presence predictability. P. kuhlii expanded its geographical range by about 394 % in the last four decades, a process that can be interpreted as a response to climate change.","[""Animal Distribution"",""Animals"",""Chiroptera"",""Climate Change"",""Models, Biological"",""Rain"",""Seasons"",""Temperature"",""Urbanization""]","[""Chiroptera"",""Distribution"",""Global change"",""Model"",""Pipistrelle""]",10.1007/s00114-016-1334-7,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957562066,,0

Within this field, however, it is a contested concept: at once presented as a sphere for creativity, democratic access and freedom of speech, but one that denies property rights and misappropriates the public domain. In this book, Merima Bruncevic takes up the cultural commons not merely as an abstract notion, but in its connection to physical spaces such as museums and libraries. A legal cultural commons can, she argues, be envisioned as a lawscape that can quite literally be entered and engaged with. Focusing largely on artin the context of the copyright regime, but also addressing a number of cultural heritage issues, the book draws on the work of Deleuze and Guattari in order to examine the realm of the commons as a potential space for overcoming the dichotomy between the owner and the consumer of culture. Challenging this dichotomy, it is the productive and creative potential of law itself that is elicited through the book’s approach to the commons as the empirical basis for a new legal framework, which is able to accommodate a multitude of interests and values.",,,10.4324/9781315521411,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85049708893,,0

The aim of the current research was to assess the effect of two nutrient management strategies, based on electrical conductivity (EC) or nitrate-nitrogen (N-NO3–)concentration control on plant growth, ornamental quality, plant-water relations, mineral composition, and WUE of greenhouse Hippeastrum grown in semiclosed soilless system. The recirculating nutrient solution was discharged whenever a threshold EC value of 3.0 dS·m-1 was reached (ECbased strategy), or when N-NO3– concentration decreased below the limit of 1.0 mol·m–3 (nitrate-based strategy). There were no significant differences in terms of plant growth parameters, stomatal resistance, leaf water relations, and macronutrient composition in plant tissues between the two nutrient management strategies. In the EC-and the nitratebased strategies, the recirculating nutrient solution was flushed 10 and 5 times, respectively.

In the EDWINA (Eating and Drinking Well IN dementiA) systematic review we aimed to assess effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve, maintain or facilitate food/drink intake indirectly, through food service or dining environment modification, education, exercise or behavioural interventions in people with cognitive impairment or dementia (across all settings, levels of care and support, types and degrees of dementia). Methods: We comprehensively searched Medline and twelve further databases, plus bibliographies, for intervention studies with ≥3 cognitively impaired adult participants (any type/stage). The review was conducted with service user input in accordance with Cochrane Collaboration's guidelines. We duplicated assessment of inclusion, data extraction, and validity assessment, tabulating data. Meta-analysis (statistical pooling) was not appropriate so data were tabulated and synthesised narratively. Results: We included 56 interventions (reported in 51 studies). Studies were small and there were no clearly effective, or clearly ineffective, interventions. Promising interventions included: eating meals with care-givers, family style meals, soothing mealtime music, constantly accessible snacks and longer mealtimes, education and support for formal and informal care-givers, spaced retrieval and Montessori activities, facilitated breakfast clubs, multisensory exercise and multicomponent interventions. Conclusions: We found no definitive evidence on effectiveness, or lack of effectiveness, of specific interventions but studies were small and short term. A variety of promising indirect interventions need to be tested in large, high-quality RCTs, and may be approaches that people with dementia and their formal or informal care-givers would wish to try.

How women deal with conflicting pregnancy-advice from health professionals and their social networks,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.Objective: to investigate how pregnant women deal with conflicting advice from their social networks and their caregivers and how this influenced their pregnancy-related behaviours. Design and methods: a qualitative study based on face-to-face interviews and focus-groups. We applied an inductive analysis technique closely following the 'Gioia method'. Setting: impoverished neighbourhoods in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Participants: 40 women who were pregnant, or had given birth within the last 12 months. 12 women were Native Dutch, 16 had a Moroccan background, and 12 had a Turkish background. Findings: all women faced a misalignment of advice by health professionals and social networks. For the native Dutch respondents, this misalignment did not seem to present a challenge. They had a strongly articulated preference for the advice of health professionals, and did not fear any social consequences for openly following their advice. For the women with a Turkish/Moroccan background, however, this discrepancy in advice presented a dilemma. Following one piece of advice seemed to exclude also following the other one, which would possibly entail social consequences. These women employed one of the three strategies to deal with this dilemma: a) avoiding the dilemma (secretly not following the advice of one side), b) embracing the dilemma (combining conflicting advice), and c) resolving the dilemma (communicating between both sides). Key conclusions and implications for practice: we argue that the currently popular interventions geared towards increasing the health literacy of non-Western ethnic minority pregnant women and improving communication between ethnic minority clients and caregivers are not sufficient, and might even exacerbate the dilemma some pregnant women face.

The aim of this study is to explore the extent to which possible predictors (derived from previous research as well as a conceptual model) of FLA differ for older people in poor and good health. Data are used from SHARE 2010/2011 for the 50+ populations in 16 European countries. Poor health is defined as self-report of having two or more chronic diseases assessed by a medical doctor, i.e. multimorbidity. Possible predictors of learning activities represent individual characteristics: functional limitations, demography (age, gender, marital status and household size), human capital (achieved level of education), employment, income and participation in other social activities. To assess the predictors of FLA, logistic regression models are used and average marginal estimates are compared across groups. In addition to multimorbidity, labour market activity is used as a grouping variable. The average participation of individuals in the group with multimorbidity was nearly 50 % lower than that in the group in good health (6.5 vs. 13.3 %). Regardless of multimorbidity, human capital proved to be significant predictors of FLA, especially in those active on the labour market. However, the associations were weaker in the multimorbidity group. Also, significant associations were observed of other types of social activities, in particular cultural and leisure activity and volunteering, with FLA. This study suggests that similar factors are predictors of FLA in older people with and without multimorbidity.",,"[""Active ageing"",""Human capital"",""Labour market activity"",""Learning activities"",""Morbidity"",""Older people"",""Successful ageing""]",10.1007/s10433-016-0371-6,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964325358,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10433-016-0371-6.pdf,0

Not only is their physical and mental health exposed to multiple stresses, but also their access to health care in Germany is legally restricted. Up to now, there is very limited scientific literature investigating the health-outcomes of asylum seekers in Germany. The aim of this study was to provide prevalence data on the morbidity and vaccination status of asylum seekers in a medium-sized German city. We used a structured questionnaire in a cross-sectional study on 214 adult asylum seekers (182 males, 24 females, 8 unknown) in Halle, Germany, 2015. The questionnaire inquired about the respondent’s self-reported physical health and vaccination status and assessed their mental health using the Hopkins-Symptom-Checklist-25 and the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. Pain (37.9 %) and psychological illness (depression: 54.7 %, anxiety disorder: 40.2 %; post-traumatic stress disorder: 18.2 %) were the most prevalent complaints. Among asylum seekers with psychological complaints, co-morbidity was high (64.2 % had more than one psychological disease). 5.6 % of the respondents mentioned suicidal thoughts. The prevalence of chronic diseases was low. We suggest interventions to improve asylum seekers’ health on two levels: first, the obligatory initial medical examination after the refugees’ arrival at the reception centre should be complemented with questions related to the vaccination status and the most common complaints including pain and psychological diseases. Second, medical infrastructure should be expanded to better serve the needs of culturally and linguistically diverse patient populations, so that those screened positive can be referred for early diagnosis and treatment.","[""Adult"",""Anxiety Disorders"",""Chronic Disease"",""Cities"",""Depressive Disorder"",""Female"",""Germany"",""Health Status"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Mental Health"",""Morbidity"",""Prevalence"",""Refugees"",""Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Urban Population"",""Vaccination""]","[""Asylum seekers"",""Health"",""Mental health"",""Pain"",""Refugees"",""Vaccination""]",10.1007/s10654-016-0148-4,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962866742,,0

The total selected heavy metal load contribution into the sea is calculated in about 21,257.85 kg year−1, showing that this River should account as one of the main contribution sources of heavy metals in the Mediterranean Sea.

Having rejected the distinction between uncertainty and risk, financiers take risk quantification as an incontrovertible given. Quantifying risk has become a key feature in modern finance ever since the difference between risk and uncertainty was rejected by financiers. Two reasons underlie this state of affairs: first the prevalent rationalist paradigm as expounded by highly reputed university professors has elevated ""quantifiable risk"" to a dogma. Additionally, this idea of risk, and its quantifiable limits, gain acceptance by society to the extent that systemic risk is constrained by a further concept: efficient markets.

After the introduction of the Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) into the European Wadden Sea, many mussel beds developed into oyster dominated bivalve beds. Despite the fact that oysters have been colonizing many European intertidal areas for about two decades, their impact on the ecosystem is still poorly understood. Here, we investigated the impact of oysters on the condition of mussels and on the spatial distribution of birds on 18 bivalve beds with different grades of oyster occurrence throughout the Dutch Wadden Sea. Moreover, in comparing bird densities on bivalve beds with densities expected on the total intertidal area, we could detect which species exhibit a preference for the structured habitat. Overall, 50 different bird species were observed on the beds, of which about half regularly frequent intertidal flats. Most of these species showed a preference for bivalve beds. The condition of mussels decreased with the oyster dominance, whereas the majority of bird species was not affected by the oyster occurrence. However, three of the four species that were negatively affected depend on intertidal mussels as food source.

Methods and Findings: Studies were identified from 15 databases (including MEDLINE and Embase) and by handsearching, reference checking, internet searches, and contacting experts. The last database searches were conducted in July 2016. There were 28 methodological evaluations that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 9 studies compared the proportion of trials reporting adverse events by publication status. The median percentage of published documents with adverse events information was 46% compared to 95% in the corresponding unpublished documents. There was a similar pattern with unmatched studies, for which 43% of published studies contained adverse events information compared to 83% of unpublished studies. A total of 11 studies compared the numbers of adverse events in matched published and unpublished documents. The percentage of adverse events that would have been missed had each analysis relied only on the published versions varied between 43% and 100%, with a median of 64%. Within these 11 studies, 24 comparisons of named adverse events such as death, suicide, or respiratory adverse events were undertaken. In 18 of the 24 comparisons, the number of named adverse events was higher in unpublished than published documents. Additionally, 2 other studies demonstrated that there are substantially more types of adverse events reported in matched unpublished than published documents. There were 20 meta-analyses that reported the odds ratios (ORs) and/or risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events with and without unpublished data. Inclusion of unpublished data increased the precision of the pooled estimates (narrower 95% confidence intervals) in 15 of the 20 pooled analyses, but did not markedly change the direction or statistical significance of the risk in most cases. The main limitations of this review are that the included case examples represent only a small number amongst thousands of meta-analyses of harms and that the included studies may suffer from publication bias, whereby substantial differences between published and unpublished data are more likely to be published. Conclusions: There is strong evidence that much of the information on adverse events remains unpublished and that the number and range of adverse events is higher in unpublished than in published versions of the same study. The inclusion of unpublished data can also reduce the imprecision of pooled effect estimates during meta-analysis of adverse events.","[""Clinical Trials as Topic"",""Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"",""Humans"",""Meta-Analysis as Topic"",""Publication Bias"",""Review Literature as Topic"",""Risk Assessment""]",,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002127,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989902038,https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002127&type=printable,0

Methods: We considered three sources of data: (1) an annual federal survey presenting data on more than 60% of all patients, (2) a project involving 109 patients with alcohol diagnoses, as assessed by therapists and external researchers, (3) an ongoing prospective evaluation study to determine whether categorical diagnoses by therapists and a short dimensional assessment (Personality Assessment Schedule - Cluster B Version) can be related to the treatment outcome (in particular: release after positive course of treatment vs. termination of treatment and return to prison). Results: (1) The rate of patients with PD diagnosis declined over 20 years from 70% to less than 25%, which hardly complies with other parameters (like rate of negative treatment outcome). (2) PD diagnosis by therapists and researchers concur hardly better than expected by chance. (3) Categorical diagnoses by staff do not predict treatment outcome; the short dimensional assessment does. Conclusions: The validity of therapists' PD diagnoses must be doubted. The forensic treatment centers have been stabilized a lot over the past decades; problematic occurrences (e. g., escape or drug use) are much less frequent.

The aim of the study is to identify the best antifungal drug for hematologic immunocompromised patients with CDC. Methods: In this multicentric retrospective study, the charts of 20 patients with CDC following cytotoxic agent protocols for hematological malignancies, diagnosed from 2003 to 2013, were analyzed. The response to systemic antifungal therapy within 90 days from CDC diagnosis and the possible delay in chemotherapy plan, due to the infection, were evaluated. Results: Six patients were treated with high-dose (HD; 5 mg/kg/daily) liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), whereas three received standard-dose (SD) L-AmB (3 mg/kg/daily). Azoles were given to six patients; the remaining five were treated with echinocandins. All patients treated with HD L-AmB (6/6—100 %) achieved complete resolution of CDC; one of them had to interrupt the chemotherapy program for the infection. In the SD L-AmB group, treatment failed in the 100 % of cases and one patient had to delay chemotherapy for the infection. Of the six patients who received azoles, two achieved complete resolution of the infection, four experienced treatment failure, and only three performed chemotherapy as planned. Echinocandins treatment resulted in complete resolution of the infection in 2/5 cases, partial response in 2/5 cases, and failure in one case.

CC Attribution 3.0 License..The atmospheric cycle of phosphorus (P) is parameterized here in a state-of-the-art global 3-D chemistry transport model, taking into account primary emissions of total P (TP) and soluble P (DP) associated with mineral dust, combustion particles from natural and anthropogenic sources, bioaerosols, sea spray and volcanic aerosols. For the present day, global TP emissions are calculated to be roughly 1.33 Tg-P yr-1, with the mineral sources contributing more than 80 % to these emissions. The P solubilization from mineral dust under acidic atmospheric conditions is also parameterized in the model and is calculated to contribute about one-third (0.14 Tg-P yr-1) of the global DP atmospheric source. To our knowledge, a unique aspect of our global study is the explicit modeling of the evolution of phosphorus speciation in the atmosphere. The simulated present-day global annual DP deposition flux is 0.45 Tg-P yr-1 (about 40 % over oceans), showing a strong spatial and temporal variability. Present-day simulations of atmospheric P aerosol concentrations and deposition fluxes are satisfactory compared with available observations, indicating however an underestimate of about 70 % on current knowledge of the sources that drive the P atmospheric cycle. Sensitivity simulations using preindustrial (year 1850) anthropogenic and biomass burning emission scenarios showed a present-day increase of 75 % in the P solubilization flux from mineral dust, i.e., the rate at which P is converted into soluble forms, compared to preindustrial times, due to increasing atmospheric acidity over the last 150 years. Future reductions in air pollutants due to the implementation of air-quality regulations are expected to decrease the P solubilization flux from mineral dust by about 30 % in the year 2100 compared to the present day. Considering, however, that all the P contained in bioaerosols is readily available for uptake by marine organisms, and also accounting for all other DP sources, a total bioavailable P flux of about 0.17 Tg-P yr-1 to the oceans is derived. Our calculations further show that in some regions more than half of the bioavailable P deposition flux to the ocean can originate from biological particles, while this contribution is found to maximize in summer when atmospheric deposition impact on the marine ecosystem is the highest due to ocean stratification. Thus, according to this global study, a largely unknown but potentially important role of terrestrial bioaerosols as suppliers of bioavailable P to the global ocean is also revealed. Overall, this work provides new insights to the atmospheric P cycle by demonstrating that biological materials are important carriers of bioavailable P, with very important implications for past and future responses of marine ecosystems to global change.",,,10.5194/bg-13-6519-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006340295,https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/6519/2016/bg-13-6519-2016.pdf,0

The ‘formal reality’, however, frequently disregards the cultural nature of these concepts, elevating them to the role of objective spaces apt to serve as acceptable guiding perspectives. While the analytical inadequacy of rural-urban ideations is well-documented, the phenomenon of formal-cultural conflation remains much less explored. Acknowledging that ideational space of social representations can only exist through the practices of discursive interaction, this paper’s objective is to lay bare the phenomenon of rural-urban thinking when externalized through the little-known practices of ‘degradation’ and ‘restitution’ in Poland. Using conceptual methods, including discourse analysis and historical deconstruction, this paper assays the hidden architectures of formal-cultural conflation by means of a richly contextualized analysis. The findings, presented in four discursive openings, reveal embedded elements of hierarchy, loss, injustice and self-victimization, which may create a divisive culture spawned by elusive promises of development at the cost of misinterpretations of history, local disappointment and cultural segmentation.

We analyzed differences in the access to EVT by geographical areas in Catalonia, a territory with a highly decentralized stroke model. Methods - We studied 965 patients treated with EVT from a prospective multicenter population-based registry of stroke patients treated with reperfusion therapies in Catalonia, Spain (SONIIA). Three different areas were defined: (A) health areas primarily covered by Comprehensive Stroke Centers, (B) areas primarily covered by local stroke centers located less than hour away from a Comprehensive Stroke Center, and (C) areas primarily covered by local stroke centers located more than hour away from a Comprehensive Stroke Center. We compared the number of EVT×100 000 inhabitants/year and time from stroke onset to groin puncture between groups. Results - Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Throughout the study period, there were significant differences in the population rates of EVT across geographical areas. EVT rates by 100 000 in 2015 were 10.5 in A area, 3.7 in B, and 2.7 in C. Time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 82 minutes longer in group B (312 minutes [245-435]) and 120 minutes longer in group C (350 minutes [284-408]) compared with group A (230 minutes [160-407]; P<0.001).

Our method, which combines the TRNSYS 17 simulation software with life cycle assessment and multi-objective optimization, identifies optimal CSHPSS designs for any climatic condition and heating demand profile considering economic and environmental criteria simultaneously. The capabilities of this approach are illustrated through its application to a case study of a CSHPSS located in Barcelona (Spain), which satisfies a heating demand for a neighborhood of 1120 dwellings. Numerical results show that the CSHPSS plant leads to significant environmental and economic improvements compared to the use of a conventional natural gas heating system.

Organisms: The fossil record of 58 extinct marine invertebrate groups belonging to six different animal phyla, ranging from the early Palaeozoic to the early Cenozoic, and including a total of 21,554 species. Methods: We tested six different models of biodiversity evolution by means of maximum likelihood estimation. The models reproduce familiar, long-standing hypotheses on biodiversity controls (such as adaptive radiation, Van Valen's Red Queen, and density-dependence). Results: For nearly 90% of the fossil clades analysed, the best model includes an early diversification phase, and increased extinction rate over time. These features are consistent regardless of whether the main determinants of species diversity in the models are ecological or evolutionary. Clades terminated by mass extinctions did not have shorter duration than other clades but were characterized by earlier divergence and greater species richness than other clades. Conclusion: An early rapid diversification, coupled with a late increase in extinction, is common to the majority of clades, and predicted by the most successful models of biodiversity evolution. This path is consistent with both evolutionary and ecological factors (or better, a combination of the two). The separation of ecological and evolutionary factors as determinants of biodiversity pathways seems neither justified nor necessary.",,"[""Adaptive radiation"",""Diversification rate"",""Diversity trend"",""Diversity-dependence"",""Key innovation""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019761422,,0

To meet this need at the broadest level, beyond the specific technology foci of previous research, a research project was commissioned as part of Dutch Electromagnetic Fields and Health Research Programme. This study provides an assessment of Dutch EMF information needs from an ensemble of sources by addressing peoples existing ideas and beliefs, using a mental models approach. A summary expert model of influences on and consequences of exposure derived from search of the relevant literature is informed by interviews with 15 scientists and professionals with diverse expertise. Although the professionals characterize the physical characteristics and psychological aspects of exposure to EMF in daily life similarly, there is no consensus regarding potential health effects. Interviews with 12 lay people followed by a confirmatory survey of the general Dutch public (n = 403) reveal not only wide variation in beliefs regarding potential health effects of EMF, but also overestimation of the amount of radiation from public sources relative to personal sources of EMF. People do not feel adequately informed by the government about EMF, and knowledge of government policies on EMF is limited. Together, the evidence suggests three focal points for improving EMF risk communications: providing more clarity regarding the uncertainty of evidence for health effects, illuminating personal EMF exposures in daily life and providing more accessible and transparent information on governmental policies.","[""Governmental policies"",""Mental model"",""Physical characteristics"",""Potential health"",""Potential health risks"",""Precautionary policies"",""Psychological Aspects"",""Risk communication""]","[""electromagnetic fields"",""mental models"",""risk communication""]",10.1080/13669877.2014.961519,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84911489324,,0

All rights reserved.In the framework of ethical consumerism, the interest for food waste and food waste prevention is steadily growing. A significant portion of food waste is created at the household level, therefore consumer behavior and its psychological antecedents are very important in relation to this timely issue. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior (Ajzen 1991), the current study investigated whether the intention to reduce household food waste could be predicted by attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Moreover, research aims to investigate the effect of food waste habits on intentions to reduce food waste. Do habits influence the future intention to reduce food waste? If this is the case, is this effect direct, or rather mediated by attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, as the TPB would predict? Finally, we were interested to test the effects of a set of key concerns emerged in a recent study (La Barbera et al., 2016) on the food waste habit. Results show that the TPB constructs adequately predict participants’ future intention to reduce food waste. In line with the TPB, food waste habit indirectly affects future intention through the mediation of attitude and perceived behavioral control. Finally, we found that the concern related to the negative environmental consequences of food waste is the only one which significantly affects food waste habit.

However, we lack direct experimental evidence of how the net carbon uptake of ecosystems is affected by ECEs under future elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (eCO2). Taking advantage of an advanced controlled environment facility for ecosystem research (Ecotron), we simulated eCO2 and extreme cooccurring heat and drought events as projected for the 2050s and analyzed their effects on the ecosystem-level carbon and water fluxes in a C3 grassland. Our results indicate that eCO2 not only slows down the decline of ecosystem carbon uptake during the ECE but also enhances its recovery after the ECE, as mediated by increases of root growth and plant nitrogen uptake induced by the ECE. These findings indicate that, in the predicted near future climate, eCO2 could mitigate the effects of extreme droughts and heat waves on ecosystem net carbon uptake.","[""Carbon"",""Carbon Cycle"",""Carbon Dioxide"",""Climate Change"",""Droughts"",""Grassland"",""Hot Temperature"",""Plant Leaves"",""Soil""]","[""Carbon fluxes"",""Climate change"",""Elevated CO2"",""Extreme events"",""Grassland ecosystem""]",10.1073/pnas.1524527113,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973115928,https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/113/22/6224.full.pdf,0

However, for motile taxa that depend on stand maturity attributes, these limitations may be less relevant. Moreover, while certain habitats may be created rapidly, the development of other habitats may take a long time. Forest continuity and stand maturity may therefore have additive effects on biodiversity. Understanding their relative influence on biodiversity is crucial for conservation. We explored the response of species and functional trait composition of saproxylic beetle assemblages using a balanced sampling design in which we crossed forest continuity (ancient vs recent) and stand maturity (mature vs overmature). We established forty plots in montane forests where we sampled beetles. Stand maturity, related to deadwood resources, induced a strong environmental filtering on both species and functional trait composition. Regardless of forest continuity, species preferring large wood of late decay stages were more abundant in overmature stands. Moreover, overmature stands enhanced the co-occurrence of different saproxylic beetles with contrasting resource requirements. Forest continuity interacting with stand maturity induced taxonomic and functional changes in communities. Compared to other forest types, overmature stands in ancient forests hosted assemblages with many more characteristic species, with a larger average body size and species that prefer large deadwood pieces. Finally, a greater diversity of body sizes was found in these forests. Saproxylic species conservation should therefore benefit from strategies that favor setting-aside overmature stands in ancient forests, promoting sites with higher amounts and heterogeneity of deadwood.",,"[""Assemblage structure"",""Biodiversity conservation"",""Functional composition"",""Habitat continuity"",""Habitat quality""]",10.1016/j.biocon.2016.11.021,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85001968631,,0

WWT parameters such as the activated sludge (AS) concentration, shear rate and ionic strength were varied in kinetic batch attachment and sedimentation studies using silver NPs having nominal 20 or 80 nm sizes and citrate or PEG coatings. The fitted attachment and detachment rate constants and the resulting distribution ratios at steady state varied with WWT process parameters, but most notably with the NP size, which was also found to influence the settling rates most. The NP coating molecules had a limited or no effect. A meta-analysis of literature distribution ratios (attached/detached concentration) of NPs composed of Ag and other materials showed the NP (aggregate) size as the only significant parameter. However, while the distribution ratio of silver NPs to AS increased linearly with AS concentration, the final effect of NP effluent concentrations is partly offset by decreased sedimentation rates. The results thus confirm that a WWT process is efficient in removing NPs from wastewater, but relatively small (<20 nm) non-aggregated NPs are somewhat more likely to exit a WWT process via the effluent into aquatic compartments compared to relatively larger NPs, which nearly entirely leave the WWT plants with the AS towards soils, incineration plants or landfills.",,,10.1039/c7en00734e,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85033594597,,0

In this study, we explore the effects of micro and macro level factors in explaining an individual's propensity to ‘trust others'. We hypothesize that higher levels of education will lead to higher social trust in individuals, given that the context (country or regions within countries) in which they reside has a sufficiently impartial and non-corrupt institutional setting. However, the positive effect of education on trust among individuals is expected to be negligible in contexts with greater levels of corruption and favoritism toward certain people are more inclined to view the system as ‘rigged' as they become more educated. This multi-level interaction effect is tested using original survey data of 85,000 individuals in 24 European countries. Using hierarchical modelling, we find strong support for our hypothesis.

The aim was to assess whether a reduction in N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is associated with improved mortality/morbidity in an unselected population of HFmrEF and HFpEF patients. Methods and Results-In the Swedish Heart Failure Registry, HFmrEF (EF=40%-49%) and HFpEF (EF≥50%) patients reporting at least 2 consecutive outpatient NT-proBNP assessments were prospectively studied. Associations between reduction in NT-proBNP and overall mortality, HF hospitalization, and their composite were assessed by multivariable Cox regressions, with NT-proBNP changes modeled as binary (decrease/increase) or quantitative predictor by restricted cubic splines. In 650 patients, at a median of 7 months between the 2 measurements of NT-proBNP and over a median follow-up of 1.65 years, 361 patients (55%) showed a reduction and 289 patients (45%) an increase in NT-proBNP. Change in NT-proBNP was associated with risk of outcomes. Fifty-seven patients (16%) who decreased their NT-proBNP versus 78 patients (27%) who increased it died from any cause (adjusted hazard ratio=0.53; 95% confidence interval=0.36-0.77), 61 (17%) versus 86 (30%) were hospitalized for HF (hazard ratio=0.41; 95% confidence interval=0.29-0.60), and 96 (27%) versus 125 (43%) reported the composite outcome (hazard ratio=0.46; 95% confidence interval=0.34-0.62). These findings were replicated in HFmrEF and HFpEF separately. Conclusions-In HFmrEF and HFpEF during routine care, decreases in NT-proBNP were associated with improved mortality and morbidity.

Organizations that perform research and development permanently seek mechanisms for supporting business and entrepreneurship though facilitating the development of disruptive technologies and new product and service development. Over the last decade, public sector agencies such as the European Space Agency (ESA) and its member states have acknowledged the importance of technology transfer and the need for business incubation centres to support new ventures. ESA has initiated a network of business incubation centres (BICs) throughout Europe. Additionally, other activities have been initiated by government. These centres essentially work as `brokers' who specialize in identifying game changing technologies and facilitate in adapting them for adaptation in another industry in search of commercial opportunities. The objective of this study is to develop a set of design principles for technology transfer and incubation practices, based on current literature and existing incubation practices in the sector. This study adopts a science-based design to investigate prevailing business incubation practices in the European space sector. The study focuses on entrepreneurs (start-ups and SMEs) in the sector, conducting or finishing their incubating period in space-related business incubators (e.g. ESA BICs) in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.

We tested the hypothesis that rainbow trout with low lipid% have genetically better FCR, and that lipid% may be genetically related to retention efficiency of macronutrients, making lipid% a useful indicator trait. A quantitative genetic analysis was used to quantify the benefit of replacing feed intake in a selection index with one of three lipid traits: body lipid%, muscle lipid% or viscera% weight of total body weight (reflecting visceral lipid). The index theory calculations showed that simultaneous selection for weight gain and against feed intake (direct selection to improve FCR) increased the expected genetic response in FCR by 1·50-fold compared with the sole selection for growth. Replacing feed intake in the selection index with body lipid%, muscle lipid% or viscera% increased genetic response in FCR by 1·29-, 1·49- and 1·02-fold, respectively, compared with the sole selection for growth. Consequently, indirect selection for weight gain and against muscle lipid% was almost as effective as direct selection for FCR. Fish with genetically low body and muscle lipid% were more efficient in turning ingested protein into protein weight gain. Both physiological and genetic mechanisms promote the hypothesis that low-lipid% fish are more efficient. These results highlight that in breeding programmes of rainbow trout, control of lipid deposition improves not only FCR but also protein-retention efficiency. This improves resource efficiency of aquaculture and reduces nutrient load to the environment.","[""Adiposity"",""Animals"",""Aquaculture"",""Diet, Fat-Restricted"",""Dietary Fats"",""Energy Intake"",""Female"",""Finland"",""Intra-Abdominal Fat"",""Lipid Metabolism"",""Male"",""Models, Biological"",""Nutrigenomics"",""Oncorhynchus mykiss"",""Random Allocation"",""Seafood"",""Selection, Genetic"",""Selective Breeding"",""Weight Gain""]","[""Breeding programmes"",""Feed intake"",""Index selection"",""Quantitative genetics""]",10.1017/S0007114516003603,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994164360,https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/3EDE68B690CF7B7CE54F1ACA5ED2CF40/S0007114516003603a.pdf/div-class-title-genetic-improvement-of-feed-conversion-ratio-via-indirect-selection-against-lipid-deposition-in-farmed-rainbow-trout-span-class-italic-oncorhynchus-mykiss-span-walbaum-div.pdf,0

Methods In total, 1129 fifth-grade children from 57 elementary schools in Sogn og Fjordane County, Norway, were cluster-randomized by school either to the intervention group or to the control group. The children in the 28 intervention schools participated in a physical activity intervention between November 2014 and June 2015 consisting of three components: 1) 90 min/week of physically active educational lessons mainly carried out in the school playground; 2) 5 min/day of physical activity breaks during classroom lessons; 3) 10 min/day physical activity homework. Academic performance in numeracy, reading and English was measured using standardized Norwegian national tests. Physical activity was measured objectively by accelerometry. Results We found no effect of the intervention on academic performance in primary analyses (standardized difference 0.01–0.06, p > 0.358).

Therefore, we set up a climosequence-approach to study the effect of exposure and, in general, climate, on the microbial biomass and microbial diversity and activity, comprising five pairs of north (N)- and south (S)-facing sites along an altitudinal gradient ranging from 1200 to 2400 m a.s.l. in the Italian Alps (Trentino Alto Adige, Italy). Soil physico-chemical properties were related to microbiological properties (microbial biomass: double strand DNA yield vs. substrate-induced respiration; diversity of bacterial, fungal and archaeal communities: genetic fingerprinting DGGE vs. real-time PCR; microbial activity: basal respiration vs. multiple hydrolytic enzyme assays) to monitor shifts in the diversity and activity of microbial communities as a function of slope exposure and to evaluate the most determinant chemical parameters shaping the soil microbiota. The exposure-effect on several hydrolytic key-enzymes was enzyme-specific: e.g. acid phosphomonoesterase potential activity was more pronounced at the N-facing slope while the activities of alkaline phosphomonoesterase, pyrophosphate-phosphodiesterase and arylsulfatase were higher at the S-facing slope. Furthermore, this exposure-effect was domain-specific: bacteria (S > N, altitude-independent); fungi (N ~ S); and archaea (N > S; altitude-dependent). Additionally, the abiotic parameters shaping the community composition were in general depending on soil depth.

They (Cl, Br and I) have recently also been shown to impact the troposphere, notably by reducing the mixing ratios of O3 and OH. Their potential for impacting regional air-quality is less well understood. We explore the impact of halogens on regional pollutants (focussing on O3) with the European grid of the GEOS-Chem model (0.25° × 0.3125°). It has recently been updated to include a representation of halogen chemistry. We focus on the summer of 2015 during the ICOZA campaign at the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory on the North Sea coast of the UK. Comparisons between these observations together with those from the UK air-quality network show that the model has some skill in representing the mixing ratios/concentration of pollutants during this period. Although the model has some success in simulating the Weybourne ClNO2 observations, it significantly underestimates ClNO2 observations reported at inland locations. It also underestimates mixing ratios of IO, OIO, I2 and BrO, but this may reflect the coastal nature of these observations. Model simulations, with and without halogens, highlight the processes by which halogens can impact O3. Throughout the domain O3 mixing ratios are reduced by halogens. In northern Europe this is due to a change in the background O3 advected into the region, whereas in southern Europe this is due to local chemistry driven by Mediterranean emissions. The proportion of hourly O3 above 50 nmol mol-1 in Europe is reduced from 46% to 18% by halogens. ClNO2 from N2O5 uptake onto sea-salt leads to increases in O3 mixing ratio, but these are smaller than the decreases caused by the bromine and iodine. 12% of ethane and 16% of acetone within the boundary layer is oxidised by Cl. Aerosol response to halogens is complex with small (∼10%) reductions in PM2.5 in most locations. A lack of observational constraints coupled to large uncertainties in emissions and chemical processing of halogens make these conclusions tentative at best. However, the results here point to the potential for halogen chemistry to influence air quality policy in Europe and other parts of the world.",,,10.1039/c7fd00026j,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028348721,https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlepdf/2017/fd/c7fd00026j,0

For trend analyses, the study period was specific to each country. Results were reported from 1992 to 2004 in France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and from 2000 to 2004 in Belgium and Portugal. These analyses were carried out using a flexible excess rate modelling strategy. There were little differences between countries in age-standardized net survivals (2000-2004). The 5-year net survival was poor (range: 6-10%). The changes in net survival from 1992 to 2004 were mostly related to early survival and patients aged 60 years. A slight decrease in the excess mortality rate between 1992 and 2004 was observed, limited to the 18 months after diagnosis. This study confirmed that, despite some improvement, survival from pancreatic cancer is still poor throughout European Latin countries. The major improvements in clinical imaging did not result in improvements in prognosis. Development of truly innovative treatments is highly needed to improve prognosis.","[""Aged"",""Belgium"",""Databases, Factual"",""Europe"",""Female"",""France"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Pancreatic Neoplasms"",""Population Surveillance"",""Portugal"",""Registries"",""Spain"",""Survival Rate"",""Switzerland""]","[""Cancer registries"",""Europe"",""Excess mortality rate"",""Net survival"",""Pancreatic cancer"",""Trend analysis""]",10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000303,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010190157,,0

Because of the sensitive to a variety of environmental factors the two categories of organism are used as excellent indicators of changes taking place in water ecosystems, especially eutrophication. Sampling of benthic diatoms and macroinvertebrates has been carried out in five stations along the river during April-May 2014 in order to apply the ICMi and the STAR-ICMi and assess river quality. The data showed a diversification in diatomic and macroinvertebrate communities in relation to environmental stresses and level of pollution, with the disappearance of species higher sensitive to eutrophication and organic load in the upper course of the river. River water quality was found to deteriorate from the upperstream to the downstream because of the increasing of human impact and the intensive agriculture activity along the river. We conclude that the monitoring of diatomic and macroinvertebrate communities could give detailed information about the ecological status of rivers.

However, dramatic changes in the preschool sector are taking place. A recent law states that it is a child’s right to get a preschool place within a few months. As a consequence, the number of children in preschool has increased, which could influence group sizes since there is no state regulation of the number of children in a group. This article based on the project The impact of group size on children’s affordances in preschool aims to describe and analyse preschool teachers’ ideas of what an ideal preschool group is. It is a qualitative study based on a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions, answered by preschool teachers. The results show that preschool teachers define a well-functioning group as having a balance between gender, age and ethnicity. The preschool teachers stress that they prefer a group with fewer children than they have today. A key aspect of having a well-functioning group is also the preschool teachers’ competence and the preschool environment.

We examined metabolic rate, shell morphometry, and calcification in the sea hare Aplysia punctata under short-term exposure (19 days) to an extreme ocean acidification scenario (pH 7.3, ~2800 μatm pCO2), along with a group held in control conditions (pH 8.1, ~344 μatm pCO2). This gastropod and its congeners are broadly distributed and locally abundant grazers, and have an internal shell that protects the internal organs. Specimens were examined for metabolic rate via closed-chamber respirometry, followed by removal and examination of the shell under confocal microscopy. Staining using calcein determined the amount of new calcification that occurred over 6 days at the end of the acclimation period. The width of new, pre-calcified shell on the distal shell margin was also quantified as a proxy for overall shell growth. Aplysia punctata showed a 30% reduction in metabolic rate under low pH, but calcification was not affected. This species is apparently able to maintain calcification rate even under extreme low pH, and even when under the energetic constraints of lower metabolism. This finding adds to the evidence that calcification is a largely autonomous process of crystallization that occurs as long as suitable haeomocoel conditions are preserved. There was, however, evidence that the accretion of new, noncalcified shell material may have been reduced, which would lead to overall reduced shell growth under longerterm exposures to low pH independent of calcification. Our findings highlight that the chief impact of ocean acidification upon the ability of marine invertebrates to maintain their shell under low pH may be energetic constraints that hinder growth of supporting structure, rather than maintenance of calcification.","[""Animal Shells"",""Animals"",""Aplysia"",""Calcification, Physiologic"",""Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"",""Oceans and Seas"",""Seawater""]",,10.1086/690094,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995695214,http://www.vliz.be/imisdocs/publications/307246.pdf,0

Objective To compare mortality rates in patients receiving ET alone versus ET + RAD. Design, settings, and participants From 1996 to 2002, 875 Scandinavian patients with high-risk (90%) or intermediate PCa were randomized to ET or ET + RAD (The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-7). After 3 mo with total androgen blockade in all patients, all individuals continued lifelong antiandrogen monotherapy. Those randomized to ET + RAD started prostate radiotherapy (70 Gy) at 3 mo. Outcome, measurements and statistical analysis PCa-specific 15-yr mortality represented the primary endpoint. Assessment of the combination treatment effect and prognostic factors was performed in competing risk analyses and Cox proportional-hazard models. Intervention RAD added to ET. Results and limitations With a median observation time of 12 yr, the 15-yr PCa-specific mortality rates were 34% (95% confidence interval, 29–39%) and 17% (95% confidence interval, 13–22%) in the ET and ET + RAD arms respectively (p < 0.001). Compared with the ET arm, the median overall survival in the ET + RAD arm was prolonged by 2.4 yr. Treatment with ET alone, age ≥65 yr and increasing histology grade independently increased the risk of PCa-specific and overall mortality. Limitations include nonformal evaluation of comorbidity, the inability to calculate progression-free survival, and lack of information about salvage therapy and toxicity. Conclusions In patients with nonmetastatic locally advanced or aggressive PCa, ET + RAD reduces the absolute risk of PCa-specific death by 17% at 15 yr compared with ET alone; the comparable 15-yr PCa-specific mortality rates being 17% and 34%. The results warrant a phase 3 study comparing ET + RAD with radical prostatectomy in high-risk PCa.

To date, the impact of self-categorization on stress has mainly been studied for low-status groups. This article uses an interview study among management consultants to explore how self-categorization in terms of occupational identity impacts work stress in a high-status occupation. Adding to previous research, we find that not only low-status but also high-status groups benefit from self-categorization when coping with stressful situations. In line with prevailing theoretical assumptions, we even empirically find an ‘upward spiral’. We illustrate how consultants’ social identity as high-performing professionals helps them cope with stress, which in turn creates a feeling of social inclusion. However, we also find a ‘downward spiral’, where social identity provokes work stress among management consultants who cannot meet the high occupational standards. They cope less effectively and fear social exclusion from the group. These new findings relate to the specifics of our research context, including high status and increased stress. We thus argue for a research agenda that includes such context characteristics when further developing self-categorization models of stress.",,"[""high-status group"",""management consulting"",""self-categorization"",""social identity"",""work stress""]",10.1177/0018726715626255,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979896186,,0

This study provides a first assessment of continuous sub-national trajectories of blue water consumption, renewable freshwater availability, and water scarcity for the entire 20 th century. Water scarcity is analysed using the fundamental concepts of shortage (impacts due to low availability per capita) and stress (impacts due to high consumption relative to availability) which indicate difficulties in satisfying the needs of a population and overuse of resources respectively. While water consumption increased fourfold within the study period, the population under water scarcity increased from 0.24 billion (14% of global population) in the 1900s to 3.8 billion (58%) in the 2000s. Nearly all sub-national trajectories show an increasing trend in water scarcity. The concept of scarcity trajectory archetypes and shapes is introduced to characterize the historical development of water scarcity and suggest measures for alleviating water scarcity and increasing sustainability. Linking the scarcity trajectories to other datasets may help further deepen understanding of how trajectories relate to historical and future drivers, and hence help tackle these evolving challenges.",,,10.1038/srep38495,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991001049,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep38495.pdf,0

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting A nationwide longitudinal dataset of the the Netherlands Perinatal Registry. Population Women with three sequential singleton pregnancies between 1999 and 2009 and a spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks in the first pregnancy. Methods We evaluated the impact of interpregnancy interval on the course of the next pregnancies. Antenatal death and/or congenital abnormalities were excluded. Conventional and conditional logistic regression analysis were applied. We adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, artificial reproductive techniques, and year of birth. Main Outcome Measures Outcomes studied were preterm birth <37 weeks, <32 weeks, low birth weight <2500 g, and small for gestational age <10th percentile. Results Among 2,361 women with preterm birth in the first pregnancy, logistic regression analysis indicated a significant effect of a short interpregnancy interval (0-5 mo) on recurrent preterm birth <37 weeks (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-3.05), <32 weeks (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.43-5.87), and low birth weight (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.79-4.03). In addition, a long interval (≥60 mo) had a significant effect on preterm birth <37 weeks (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.29-3.74). Conditional logistic regression analysis confirmed the effect of a short interval on the recurrence of preterm birth rate <37 weeks and low birth weight.

Particular attention is paid to ‘North Lucania,’ a landscape in the Apennines where in the Iron Age a population lived that remains for us anonymous (Bottini 2013). Achaeological knowledge about the area is based primarily on the research project carried out by the Università della Basilicata in Torre di Satriano (Osanna 2008; Osanna/Capozzoli 2012; Osanna et al. 2009). The new discoveries allow us to understand the structuring of the indigenous communities on the basis of a new, broader foundation. The comparison between the Lebensraum of an archaic Greek polis and this indigenous region proves to be particularly instructive for an understanding of the different social systems that came to structure the landscape. From an archaeological point of view, the Iron Age communities of North Lucania form a quite homogeneous group. Here, it is above all the ‘matt-painted’ pottery, produced between the 7th and 6th centuries BC, that plays an important role in identifying the population as an archaeological group (Bettelli et al. 2008: 204–205; Yntema 1990: 187–190). When aspects other than the specialized production of pottery are taken into consideration – for example, the custom of crouched burials – the picture of this ‘culture’ is completed, a culture that is visible in outline in its geography and environmental particularities (Bottini 1999). To date too little research has been carried out on the organization of agriculture in the area, and indeed among the indigenous cultures of Southern Italy generally. For a long time classical archaeology has seen Magna Graecia from a ‘helleno-centric’ perspective (Knapp/Van Dommelen 2010: 1–18; Van Dommelen 1998). Research has focused primarily on the Greek colonies, whereas the archaeology of the non-Greek areas was more or less restricted to funerary contexts. Without doubt the funerary rites are a central feature of the indigenous cultures and as a result are particularly prominent in the archaeological record (Bottini 1999: 315–322, 2007).",,,10.1017/9781316550328.020,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85047932385,,0

Risk factors for MCC are reported to include high age, UV exposure, Caucasian skin type and immunosuppression. The incidence is reported to be increasing. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe a Swedish cohort and calculate incidence. Methods: The study design is a retrospective cohort study of population-based data for MCC collected by the Swedish Cancer Registry to determine the incidence of MCC in Sweden and the clinical characteristics of these tumours including demographics, TNM classification, body part distribution and overall survival after diagnosis. De-identified data were collected from 1993 to 2012. Results: A total of 606 cases of MCC were identified during the study period. The median age was 81 years (range 21–99) and a majority, 54.4% were women but age-adjusted incidence is higher in men. The incidence (per 100,000) of MCC in Sweden in 1993–2012 increased from 0.09 to 0.20 for men and 0.12–0.17 for women, adjusted for age to the world standard population. For the both sexes, the increase was from 0.11 to 0.19 per 100 000, an increase of 73%. The most common site of the primary tumour was the head and neck, with 51.8% of the cases. The size of the tumour was <5 cm in 82.1% of the cases. The majority of the tumours (90.7%) had no known lymphatic spread and only a few patients had confirmed distant metastases (2.9%) when diagnosed. Conclusions: MCC is a rare disease in Sweden, but the incidence is increasing. This study supports the finding that high age, male sex and UV exposure are risk factors for MCCs.

Karger AG, Basel.The World Health Organization AIDS epidemic update estimates that more than 37 million people are living with HIV infection. Despite the unprecedented success of antiretroviral treatments, significant challenges remain in the fight against HIV. In particular, how uninfected cells capture HIV and transmit virions to target cells remains an unanswered question. Tissue mast cells and peripheral blood basophils can be exposed to virions or HIV products during infection. Several HIV proteins (i.e., envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, Tat, and Nef) can interact with distinct surface receptors expressed by human basophils and mast cells and modulate their functional responses at different levels. Additionally, several groups have provided evidence that human mast cells can be infected in vitro, as well as in vivo, by certain strains of HIV. Recently, it has been demonstrated that basophils purified from healthy donors and intestinal mast cells can efficiently capture HIV on their cell surface and, cocultured with CD4+ T cells, they can transfer the virus to the cocultured cells leading to infection. Direct contact between human basophils or intestinal mast cells and CD4+ T cells can mediate viral trans-infection of T cells through the formation of viral synapses. Thus, basophils and mast cells can provide a cellular basis for capturing and then spreading viruses throughout the body. Collectively, these findings suggest that human basophils and mast cells play a complex and possibly distinct role in HIV infection, warranting further investigations.","[""Basophils"",""HIV Infections"",""HIV-1"",""Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins"",""Humans"",""Immune System"",""Mast Cells""]","[""Basophils"",""CCR3"",""CCR5"",""CXCR4"",""HIV"",""IL-13"",""IL-4"",""Mast cells"",""Nef"",""TAT""]",10.1159/000452889,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006309124,https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/452889,0

This substantial and increasing demand has placed focus on delivering biofuel to the plants, as logistics issues are considered one of the key challenges for further increased use of biofuel. Problems in sourcing enough fuel locally due to the increasing size of power plants and environmental concerns has sparked an interest in using multimodal road-rail transport as a cost effective and environmentally friendly way of long-haul transport. A case study is performed at a Swedish district heating plant to investigate the potential of introducing multimodal transport. Extensive calculations are performed in the design and operation of a multimodal system, showing both costs and CO2 emissions. This is analysed in relation to key logistical challenges in the industry. A best case scenario is identified. Conclusions are that the potential for multimodal transport is greatest among the largest plants with large volumes to achieve high resource utilisation of the transport equipment. A shift from road to multimodal transport is facilitated by that a large share of the current road transport flows already pass through a terminal, which improves multimodal transport competitiveness against road transport as this reduced the cost difference. This study leads to better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of multimodal biofuel transport and has practical implications for anyone in the process of designing such systems.","[""Design and operations"",""District-heating plants"",""Environmental concerns"",""Heating plants"",""Intermodal"",""Resource utilisation"",""Transport"",""Wood chip""]","[""Heating plant"",""Intermodal"",""Rail"",""Transport"",""Wood biofuel"",""Wood chips""]",10.18757/ejtir.2016.16.4.3157,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84986252294,,0

Occasionally there is a high recruitment of juveniles in Kattegat/Skagerrak, without leading to the rebuilding of adult cod stocks despite reduced fishing mortality. In a biophysical model of egg and larval drift, we examined the potential importance of extant and historical spawning grounds for recruitment of cod in the Kattegat/Skagerrak seas using data of spawning stock biomass from the 1970s and from today's reduced stocks. The results suggest that Kattegat in the 1970s relied on largely locally retained (83%) larvae with little annual variation in recruitment. Kattegat also provided a substantial proportion of larvae recruiting in Swedish Skagerrak (72%). This is in contrast to present conditions where the Kattegat spawning stock has been reduced by 94%, and Kattegat only provides 34% of locally retained larvae and 30% to Swedish Skagerrak. Instead, the protected area in the Öresund and the Belt Sea are expected today to provide most larvae recruiting in Kattegat. Also, the inflow of larvae from the North Sea to Skagerrak and Kattegat can be significant although highly variable between years, with a positive correlation to the North-Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO). The rebuilding of healthy spawning areas in the Kattegat may be key for restoring local cod stocks in both Kattegat and along the Skagerrak coast.

Little information is available regarding moderate malnutrition prevalence in children under five in rural areas. Methods:To assess nutritional status and the prevalence of malnutrition in children from Ibo Island, Mozambique, a nutritional population survey in children under 5 years was carried out. A structured questionnaire was administered from April 2009 to February 2010. Anthropometric measurements were recorded as z-scores and child nutritional status derived from the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards (WHO) reference population. Resu/fs: 3313 people on Ibo were identified and interviewed and nutritional assessment was carried out in the 526 children under five. Most children had been fully vaccinated (90.5%), breastfed (100.0%), and some were also bottle fed (22.0%). The mean duration of the different feeding regimes were 20.3 + 4.47 months for breastfeeding, 2.5 + 0.8 months for exclusive breastfeeding and 3.2 + 4.0 months for bottle feeding. The mean number of daily meals across the child age range was 2.3 + 0.5. More stunted children had been exclusively breastfed than mixed fed (p = 0.058). Severe stunting was more likely in children in the s 11 (26.3%) and 12-23 (21.2%) month age groups (p = 0.007). 13.5% of severely stunted children had not been fully vaccinated (p = 0.014), 72.7% ate unassisted (p = 0.013) and 64.8% had their own dish to eat from (p = 0.001) compared to the non-stunted group. More children from the 46-60 month age group (27.7%) were underweight compared to the other groups (p = 0.047).

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA. All rights reserved.Background Mortality rates remain high for haemodialysis (HD) patients and simply increasing the HD dose to remove more small solutes does not improve survival. Online haemodiafiltration (HDF) provides additional clearance of larger toxins compared with standard HD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HDF with conventional HD on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients reported inconsistent results and were at high risk of bias. We conducted a pooled individual participant data analysis of RCTs to provide the most reliable evidence to date on the effects of HDF on mortality outcomes in ESKD patients. Methods Individual participant data were used from four trials that compared online HDF with HD and were designed to examine the effects of HDF on mortality endpoints. Bias by informative censoring of patients was resolved. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) comparing the effect of online HDF versus HD on all-cause and cause-specific mortality were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard regression models. The relationship between convection volume and the study outcomes was examined by delivered convection volume standardized to body surface area. Results After a median follow-up of 2.5 years (Q1-Q3: 1.9-3.0), 769 of the 2793 participants had died (292 cardiovascular deaths). Online HDF reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 14% (95% CI: 1%; 25%) and cardiovascular mortality by 23% (95% CI: 3%; 39%). There was no evidence for a differential effect in subgroups. The largest survival benefit was for patients receiving the highest delivered convection volume [>23 L per 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) per session], with a multivariable-adjusted HR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.62; 0.98) for all-cause mortality and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.47; 1.00) for cardiovascular disease mortality. Conclusions This pooled individual participant analysis on the effects of online HDF compared with conventional HD indicates that online HDF reduces the risk of mortality in ESKD patients. This effect holds across a variety of important clinical subgroups of patients and is most pronounced for those receiving a higher convection volume normalized to BSA.","[""Aged"",""Cause of Death"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Hemodiafiltration"",""Humans"",""Kidney Failure, Chronic"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Renal Dialysis"",""Risk Factors"",""Survival Rate""]","[""haemodialysis""]",10.1093/ndt/gfv349,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975142780,https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article-pdf/31/6/978/17172965/gfv349.pdf,0

However, new interferon-free regimens containing direct-acting antiviral agents have fewer adverse effects and better effectiveness, making HCV treatment feasible early after transplant. In 2014, we successfully used sofosbuvir and ribavirin to treat a patient with HCV genotype 3 cirrhosis who was listed for liver transplantation. Because the patient's hepatocellular carcinoma score was outside the Milan criteria, an allograft from a donor with HCV genotype 3 was accepted as rescue treatment. Patient characteristics, laboratory results, and the course of disease and treatment were documented from March 2014 to May 2015. HCV reinfection was successfully treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin early after transplant, with no adverse effects. Viral load was below detectable levels 4 weeks after start of treatment. Liver values returned to normal, and the FibroScan score improved. Sustained virologic response was documented 12 weeks after treatment. With interferon-free regimens for HCV infection, expanding the donor pool by including HCV-positive organs is an interesting option that could substantially decrease waiting times and mortality rates for patients listed for transplant.

It called for including a gender perspective into peacekeeping operations and for enhancing women’s participation in all aspects of post-conflict reconstruction. This article contributes to the empirical literature on the implementation of UNSCR 1325, examining the extent of gender mainstreaming in UN peacekeeping mandates. Situated in a theoretical framework of gradual norm cascades, it hypothesizes that UNSCR 1325 has increased gender content in mandates, but selectively so. Statistical analyses of an original dataset covering all 71 UN peacekeeping operations from 1948 until 2014 reveal that gender-mainstreamed mandates are more likely in conflicts with high levels of sexual violence. In designing gendered peacekeeping mandates, actors thus appear to be responsive to cues about the salience of a very visible, albeit narrow, gender issue emanating from the respective conflict rather than being guided by the universalist norms of women’s participation entrenched in UNSCR 1325.",,,10.1080/13533312.2016.1195267,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975129757,https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/59909/2/gupea_2077_59909_2.pdf,0

Long-term time series on metabolic rates are commonly estimated from diel changes in dissolved oxygen. Here we present long-term data on metabolic rates based on diel changes in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) utilizing an open-water diel CO2 -technique. Metabolic rates estimated with this technique and the traditional diel O2 -technique agree well in alkaline Lake Illmensee (pH of 8.5), although the diel changes in molar CO2 concentrations are much smaller than those of the molar O2 concentrations. The open-water diel CO2 - and diel O2 -techniques provide independent measures of lake metabolic rates that differ in their sensitivity to transport processes. Hence, the combination of both techniques can help to constrain uncertainties arising from assumptions on vertical fluxes due to gas exchange and turbulent diffusion. This is particularly important for estimates of lake respiration rates because these are much more sensitive to assumptions on gradients in vertical fluxes of O2 or DIC than estimates of lake gross primary production. Our data suggest that it can be advantageous to estimate respiration rates assuming negligible gradients in vertical fluxes rather than including gas exchange with the atmosphere but neglecting vertical mixing in the water column. During two months in summer the average lake net production was close to zero suggesting at most slightly autotrophic conditions. However, the lake emitted O2 and CO2 during the entire time period suggesting that O2 and CO2 emissions from lakes can be decoupled from the metabolism in the near surface layer.","[""Carbon Dioxide"",""Ecosystem"",""Lakes"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Oxygen"",""Temperature""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0168393,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007414134,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168393&type=printable,0

In particular, it aimed at verifying whether environmental actions reveal different models with respect to implementation of sustainability and at analyzing the relationship between environmental strategies and specific POs’ characteristics. Design/methodology/approach: The work is based on a field survey carried out by submitting a questionnaire to POs. Collected data were processed by means of exploratory data and multivariate analysis techniques. A cluster analysis was used to classify POs with respect to their ability/will to translate views into sustainability actions. Findings: Three different groups were identified with reference to the involvement in ethical and environmental actions. Results show that POs’ strategies often include interlinked economic and environmental objectives. In particular, product quality improvement often goes with the promotion of environmentally friendly techniques, while other environmental actions respond to a reduction costs rather than to a sustainability strategy. Research limitations/implications: Only 38 out of 300 POs returned the questionnaire.

Our analysis focuses primarily on barriers to increases in water tariffs, which are usually a main pillar of water sector reforms. Discussing the case of Peru, we illustrate that the specific structure of voting water users together with the self-interest driven behavior of politicians on the local and central level can explain why actors refrain from implementing higher water tariffs. Water suppliers on the local level are subject to strong political interference by local politicians. To address such barriers, water tariff reforms may need to be accompanied by more fundamental institutional reforms, for example, by merging local to regional water suppliers, as well as by public campaigns making the use of funds from tariff increments for service improvements more transparent and tangible for water users.",,"[""Peru"",""political economy"",""public choice"",""water sector reform"",""water tariffs""]",10.1177/1070496515619651,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958092851,,0

Marine herbivores affect seaweed biomass and community structure in marine habitats across the globe. Consequently, herbivore-seaweed interactions are expected to be important for the establishment and invasion success of non-native seaweeds. To synthesize current knowledge of consumer effects on non-native seaweeds, we performed a meta-analysis on feeding preferences of native herbivores for non-native versus native seaweeds. Data were included from 35 studies, published from 1992–2015 and comprising 18 non-native seaweeds. Results showed that overall, native herbivores tended to prefer to feed on native rather than non-native seaweeds. Preferences were, however, variable across studies with significant differences between taxonomic and functional groups of seaweeds. In particular, filamentous red non-native seaweeds were of low palatability to native herbivores. No general feeding preferences were apparent between natives and non-natives for brown and green seaweeds, or for leathery and corticated seaweeds. In addition, we reviewed the existing studies on the effects of consumers on the performance of native and non-native seaweeds in invaded communities. This indicated that non-native seaweeds performed better than their native competitors in the presence of grazers, but in many cases had superior competitive abilities also in the absence of herbivory. To achieve a comprehensive evaluation of consumers’ role in seaweed invasion success, future research should have a larger focus on manipulative community experiments, ideally on time scales that include seasonal changes and complete life cycles of the seaweeds.",,,10.1201/b21944,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053169745,https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/417148/1/Rius_etal2017OceanMarBiolAnnRev.pdf,0

Seeking patterns and overlooked processes, we performed a large-scale compilation of macro-nutrient data (hereafter termed nutrients) in Antarctic pack ice (306 ice-cores collected from 19 research cruises). Dissolved inorganic nitrogen and silicic acid concentrations change with time, as expected from a seasonally productive ecosystem. In winter, salinity-normalized nitrate and silicic acid concentrations (C∗) in sea ice are close to seawater concentrations (Cw), indicating little or no biological activity. In spring, nitrate and silicic acid concentrations become partially depleted with respect to seawater (C∗ < Cw), commensurate with the seasonal build-up of ice microalgae promoted by increased insolation. Stronger and earlier nitrate than silicic acid consumption suggests that a significant fraction of the primary productivity in sea ice is sustained by flagellates. By both consuming and producing ammonium and nitrite, the microbial community maintains these nutrients at relatively low concentrations in spring. With the decrease in insolation beginning in late summer, dissolved inorganic nitrogen and silicic acid concentrations increase, indicating imbalance between their production (increasing or unchanged) and consumption (decreasing) in sea ice. Unlike the depleted concentrations of both nitrate and silicic acid from spring to summer, phosphate accumulates in sea ice (C∗ > Cw). The phosphate excess could be explained by a greater allocation to phosphorus-rich biomolecules during ice algal blooms coupled with convective loss of excess dissolved nitrogen, preferential remineralization of phosphorus, and/or phosphate adsorption onto metal-organic complexes. Ammonium also appears to be efficiently adsorbed onto organic matter, with likely consequences to nitrogen mobility and availability. This dataset supports the view that the sea ice microbial community is highly efficient at processing nutrients but with a dynamic quite different from that in oceanic surface waters calling for focused future investigations.",,"[""Antarctica"",""Nutrients"",""Sea ice""]",10.1525/elementa.217,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020912139,http://www.elementascience.org/articles/10.1525/elementa.217/galley/775/download/,0

Location: Baltic Sea. Method: During four cruises, we isolated clonal strains of the diatom Skeletonema marinoi from 9 to 10 stations along a 1132 km transect and analysed the genetic structure using eight microsatellites. Using F-statistics and Bayesian clustering analysis we determined if samples were significantly differentiated. A seascape approach was applied to examine correlations between gene flow and oceanographic connectivity, and combined partial Mantel test and RDA based variation partitioning to investigate associations with environmental gradients. Results: The bloom was initiated during the second half of March in the southern and the northern- parts of the transect, and later propagated offshore. By mid-April the bloom declined in the south, whereas high phytoplankton biomass was recorded northward. We found two significantly differentiated populations along the transect. Genotypes were significantly isolated by distance and by the south-north salinity gradient, which illustrated that the effects of distance and environment were confounded. The gene flow among the sampled stations was significantly correlated with oceanographic connectivity. The depletion of silica during the progression of the bloom was related to a temporal population genetic shift. Main conclusions: A phytoplankton bloom may propagate as a continuous cascade and yet be genetically structured over both spatial and temporal scales. The Baltic Sea spring bloom displayed strong spatial structure driven by oceanographic connectivity and geographical distance, which was enhanced by the pronounced salinity gradient. Temporal transition of conditions important for growth may induce genetic shifts and different phenotypic strategies, which serve to maintain the bloom over longer periods.",,"[""Adaptation"",""Environmental gradient"",""Gene flow"",""Genetic structure"",""Isolation by distance"",""Population"",""Seascape"",""Skeletonema""]",10.1111/jbi.12722,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957818454,,0

We propose using fuzzy rule-based expert systems to evaluate the degree of success of restoration actions when available information on project results and impacts largely relies on expert-based qualitative assessments and rough estimates of quantitative values. These systems use fuzzy logic to manage the uncertainty present in the data and to integrate qualitative and quantitative information. To illustrate and demonstrate the potential of fuzzy rule-based systems for restoration evaluation, we applied this approach to seven forest restoration projects implemented in Spain between 1897 and 1952, using information compiled in the REACTION database on Mediterranean forest restoration projects. The information available includes both quantitative and expert-based qualitative data, and covers a wide variety of indicators grouped into technical, structural, functional, and socioeconomic criteria. The fuzzy rule-based system translates expert knowledge of restoration specialists and forest managers into a set of simple logic rules that integrate information on individual indicators into more general evaluation criteria. The rule-based approach proposed here can be readily applicable to any kind of restoration project, provided that some information, even if vague and uncertain, is available for a variety of assessment indicators.

Statistical tests of public willingness to pay's sensitivity to scope and scale are carried out. Decreasing marginal willingness to pay (WTP) is found when asking respondents to value two water quality improvement scenarios (within sample comparison), from current moderate water quality conditions to good and subsequently excellent ecological status. However, insensitivity to scale is found when asking half of the respondents to value water quality improvements in the estuary only and the other half in the whole basin (between sample comparison). Although respondents living outside the river basin value water quality improvements significantly less than respondents inside the basin, no spatial heterogeneity can be detected within the basin between upstream and downstream residents. This finding has important implications for spatial aggregation procedures across the population of beneficiaries living in the river basin to estimate its total economic value based on public WTP for the implementation of the WFD.",,"[""Contingent valuation"",""Ecosystem services"",""Spatial heterogeneity"",""Water Framework Directive"",""Willingness to pay""]",10.1016/j.ecss.2015.11.028,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957922001,,0

For this reason, some alternatives are evaluated in this manuscript to improve the conversion of this microalgae into methane.One of these alternatives is the addition of sewage sludge to Phaeodactylum tricornutum for anaerobic co-digestion. Although the co-digestion resulted in lack of synergy, the absence of inhibition indicated that both substrates could be co-digested under certain circumstances, for example if microalgae are cultivated for wastewater treatment purposes.The extraction of lipids using organic solvents has been evaluated for biodiesel production but also as a pre-treatment for anaerobic digestion. The results revealed that the type of solvent influences lipid and biodiesel yields. The high polarity of the mixture methanol/hexane increased the lipid and the biodiesel yields from 10 ± 1 to 53 ± 2 gLipids/100 gVS and from 7 ± 1 to 11 ± 1 gBiodiesel/100 gVS compared with hexane. However, none of these solvents affected the composition of biodiesel. Regarding the methane production after the extraction, it yielded 257 ± 8 and 180 ± 6 mLCH4/gVS from lipid-extracted P. tricornutum using hexane and methanol/hexane respectively. The methane production from the raw microalga was 258 ± 5 mLCH4/gVS in the same experiment. The difference in methane production, mainly after the extraction with methanol/hexane, was a consequence of the changes in the composition of the microalgae after extraction. The extraction did not influence the biodegradability.The ultrasonic pre-treatment prior anaerobic digestion completely disrupted the microalgae cells, but the solubilisation of the organic fraction was scarce (<9.5%). The methane production from pre-treated samples was barely 10-11% higher than the obtained from non pre-treated samples, indicating that the refractory nature of the organic fraction in P. tricornutum is the main obstacle for the methane production.","[""Anaerobiosis"",""Biofuels"",""Lipids"",""Methane"",""Microalgae"",""Sewage"",""Sonication"",""Waste Management"",""Waste Water""]","[""Co-digestion"",""Lipid extraction"",""Methane"",""Phaeodactylum tricornutum"",""Substrate to inoculum ratio (SIR)"",""Ultrasonic pre-treatment""]",10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.04.023,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971328600,,0

Social mechanisms have created specific models of governance, capable of assuring the persistence of ecosystems and their capacity to provide essential goods and services. In recent decades, however, dramatic changes have occurred, such as climate change and changes in land use. The complexity common to all linked human-natural environment systems is extremely marked in the Alpine areas and this makes it difficult to understand how resilient these systems may be. Many research questions arise, in particular as to the comprehension and quantification of the impact of changes on the capacity of ecosystems to produce goods and services in a sustainable way, and the possibility of local mechanisms of governance to adapt to both current and future changes. Reasons and effects of change are analysed from the perspective of the specific issues of governance. The importance of the Ecosystems Services (ESs) concept is acknowledged and the necessity for a dynamic assessment of ESs, taking into account people's values and expectations, is particularly stressed.

In this context, multi-objective optimization has attracted much attention in building design as a tool to study trade-off solutions (“cost” vs “environmental impact”) resulting from the optimization of conflicting objectives. One major limitation of this approach (as applied to building design) is that it is computationally demanding due to the need to optimize several objectives using complex models based on differential equations (which are used to estimate the energy consumed by a building). In this work, we propose a systematic framework for the design of buildings that combines a rigorous objective reduction method (which removes redundant objectives from the analysis) with a surrogate model (which simplifies the calculation of the energy requirements of the building), both of which expedite the identification of alternative designs leading to environmental improvements. The capabilities of our methodology are illustrated through a case study based on a thermal modelling of a house-like cubicle, in which we optimize the insulation thicknesses of the building envelope. Results show that significant economic and environmental improvements can be achieved compared to the base case (cubicle without insulation). Furthermore, it is clearly illustrated how the minimization of an aggregated environmental metric, like the Eco-Indicator 99, as unique environmental objective may overlook some Pareto solutions that may be appealing for decision-makers.","[""Conflicting objectives"",""Design of buildings"",""Energy requirements"",""Environmental improvements"",""Environmental objectives"",""Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)"",""Surrogate model"",""Systematic framework""]","[""Buildings"",""Insulation"",""Life cycle assessment (LCA)"",""Modelling"",""Multi-objective optimization"",""Objective reduction"",""Surrogate model""]",10.1016/j.enbuild.2016.07.062,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84985942540,http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/58076/2/2016_Carreras_etal_EnBuild_accepted.pdf,0

Despite this intensive treatment, transplant patients remain highly susceptible to relapse over time. The French SFGM-TC performed a national survey on reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic stem cell transplantation (RIC-allo-SCT) for fit relapsed/refractory patients who failed after auto-SCT (n=106). Median times of relapse after auto-SCT, and from auto-SCT to RIC-allo-SCT were 28 months and 3.6 years, respectively. Sixty per cent of patients received at least three lines of treatment before RIC-allo-SCT. Conditioning regimens for RIC-allo-SCT were heterogeneous. Twenty patients experienced grade III/IV aGvHD, extensive cGvHD was reported in 28 cases. Median follow-up after RIC-allo-SCT was 45 months. Median PFS after RIC-allo-SCT was 30.1 months and median overall survival was 62 months. Treatment-related mortality (TRM) at 1 year and 3 years were estimated at 28% and 32%, respectively. A total of 52 patients died; major causes of death were related to toxicity (n=34) and MCL (n=11). Patients in good response before RIC-allo-SCT experienced a better PFS and OS.

In a group of 26 adult participants, native speakers of 11 different native languages, we demonstrate a strong and significant correlation between the ability to detect a ""roughly"" regular beat and rapid automatized naming (RAN) as a measure of language skill (Spearman’s rho, -0.47, p < 0.01). There was no such robust relationship for the ""mirror image"" task of irregularity detection, i.e., the ability to detect ongoing small deviations from a regular beat. The correlation between RAN and regularity detection remained significant after partialling out performance on the irregularity detection task (rho, -0.41, p, 0.022), non-verbal IQ (rho, -0.37, p < 0.05), or musical expertise (rho, -0.31, p < 0.05). Whilst being consistent with the ""shared resources model"" in terms of rhythm as a common basis of language and music, evolutionarily as well as in individual development, the results also document how two related rhythm processing abilities relate differently to language skill. Specifically, the results support a universal relationship between rhythmic regularity detection and reading skill that is robust to accounting for differences in fluid intelligence and musical expertise, and transcends language-specific differences in speech rhythm.",,"[""Auditory"",""Beat"",""Cross-lingual"",""Language"",""Reading"",""Regularity"",""Rhythm"",""Timing""]",10.3389/fnhum.2016.00425,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988622192,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00425/pdf,0

Journal of Applied Ecology © 2016 British Ecological SocietySeagrass and seaweed habitats constitute hotspots for diversity and ecosystem services in coastal ecosystems. These habitats are subject to anthropogenic pressures, of which eutrophication is one major stressor. Eutrophication favours fast-growing ephemeral algae over perennial macroalgae and seagrasses, causing habitat degradation. However, changes in top-down control, caused by, for example, overfishing, may also have negative impacts on such habitats by decreasing grazer control of ephemeral algae. Meanwhile, systematic analyses estimating top-down effects of predator manipulations across a wide range of studies are missing, limiting the potential use of top-down control measures in coastal management. Here, we review the literature on experiments that test top-down and bottom-up controls in seagrass Zostera marina and seaweed Fucus spp. food webs in the North Atlantic. Using meta-analysis and meta-regression, we compare effect sizes of consumer and nutrient manipulations on primary producers, grazers and mesopredators. Presence of mesopredators on average doubled the biomass of ephemeral algae through trophic cascades, mainly mediated via negative effects on amphipods and isopods. Of the grazers, gastropods had twice as strong a negative effect on ephemeral algae as amphipods/isopods, but responded weakly to both predators and fertilization. In accordance with theory, top-down effects became stronger with eutrophication. Across studies, top-down effects on ephemeral algae at all trophic levels are on par with eutrophication effects. However, the few studies manipulating piscivorous fish make estimates of their top-down effects uncertain. Synthesis and applications. Consistently strong top-down effects in coastal ecosystems call for an integrated ecosystem perspective. Management should consider measures to improve stocks of predatory fish and reduce mesopredators for restoration and conservation of essential seagrass and seaweed habitats, thereby increasing the long-term viability of ecosystem services from coastal habitats.",,"[""bottom-up"",""coastal food webs"",""conservation"",""eutrophication"",""indirect interactions"",""marine fisheries management"",""meta-analysis"",""overfishing"",""restoration"",""review""]",10.1111/1365-2664.12654,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963563069,https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/36388618/_stman_et_al_2016_Journal_of_Applied_Ecology.pdf,0

We then assessed the risks to carnivore conservation within each country that makes a contribution to global carnivore conservation. We found that land use change will potentially lead to important range losses, particularly amongst already threatened carnivore species. In addition, the 17% of land targeted for protection under the Aichi Target 11 was found to be inadequate to conserve carnivores under expected land use change. Our results also highlight that land use change will decrease the effectiveness of carnivores to protect other threatened species, especially threatened amphibians. In addition, the risk of human-carnivore conflict is potentially high in countries where we identified spatial priorities for their conservation.

Several examples of the use of these kinematic metrics and accompanying paradigms are presented that involve important components of the social exchange. These examples and methods are discussed in light of diagnostics tools, such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and Autism Diagnostic Interview- Revised, that openly disregard sensory-motor issues in autism spectrum disorder. Paradoxically, these observational tools provide ordinal scores of social tasks that inherently require proper sensory-motor integration and both overt and covert forms of imitation for their successful completion. As such, the tools provided in this chapter may pave the way toward combining such observational tests with objective methods to eventually link subsets of imitation tasks inherently present in sociomotor behavior with the types of communication exchange such tasks inevitably require.",,,10.1201/9781315372518,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85053039563,,0

We previously showed that TM84 employs a unique tRNA-dependent mechanism to inhibit leucyl-tRNA synthetase (LeuRS), while the TM84-producer prevents self-poisoning by expressing a resistant LeuRS AgnB2. We now identify a mechanism by which the antibiotic-producing microbe resists its own toxin. Using a combination of structural, biochemical and biophysical approaches, we show that AgnB2 evolved structural changes so as to resist the antibiotic by eliminating the tRNA-dependence of TM84 binding. Mutagenesis of key resistance determinants results in mutants adopting an antibiotic-sensitive phenotype.

A systematic review was conducted to identify the extent and type of community-based agricultural and household interventions aimed at improving food security, health and the household environment in low and middle income countries. Methods: A systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, PUBMED, EMBASE and SCOPUS databases was performed. Key search words were generated reflecting the ""participants, interventions, comparators, outcomes and study design"" approach and a comprehensive search strategy was developed following ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses"" recommendations.

The majority of agricultural and nutritional studies were conducted in Africa and Asia, whereas the majority of interventions to improve household air quality were conducted in Latin America. Conclusions: It is clear that very little trans-disciplinary research has been done with the majority of studies still being discipline specific. It also appears that certain low and middle income countries seem to focus on domain-specific interventions. The review emphasizes the need to develop holistic, cross-domain intervention packages.

Despite numerous calls for risk-based water scarcity assessments, a global-scale framework that includes UNISDR's definition of risk does not yet exist. This study provides a first step towards such a risk-based assessment, applying a Gamma distribution to estimate water scarcity conditions at the global scale under historic and future conditions, using multiple climate change and population growth scenarios. Our study highlights that water scarcity risk, expressed in terms of expected annual exposed population, increases given all future scenarios, up to >56.2% of the global population in 2080. Looking at the drivers of risk, we find that population growth outweigh the impacts of climate change at global and regional scales. Using a risk-based method to assess water scarcity, we show the results to be less sensitive than traditional water scarcity assessments to the use of fixed threshold to represent different levels of water scarcity. This becomes especially important when moving from global to local scales, whereby deviations increase up to 50% of estimated risk levels.","[""Hydrological modeling"",""Probabilistic methods"",""Risk assessment framework"",""Risk-based assessments"",""Socio-economic conditions"",""Socio-economic development"",""Water scarcity"",""Water scarcity conditions""]","[""climate change"",""global hydrological modeling"",""probabilistic methods"",""risk assessment"",""socioeconomic developments"",""water resources"",""water scarcity""]",10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/024006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959440159,https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/2/024006/pdf,0

We use olivine-hosted melt inclusions, embayments, and matrix glasses to investigate major element, trace element, and volatile characteristics of Surtsey’s magmatic system, and to parameterize decompression models that describe degassing of C-H-S-O species during this well-studied eruption. Major elements show that the inclusions represent heterogeneous melts with a range of compositions similar to those of Icelandic lavas. Trace elements discriminate between two groups of inclusions: the majority are compositionally similar to Eastern Volcanic Zone alkalic basalts, and the remainder are notably more depleted in incompatible trace elements and trend toward fields defined by tholeiites on and around Iceland. Strongly correlated Cl and Nb for all inclusions indicates that seawater did not affect Surtsey’s volatile budget, despite having clearly affected its eruption style. Both types of inclusions are volatile rich (≤1.47 wt.% H2O; ≤2534 ppm CO2 as measured or ≤5286 ppm once corrected for vapor bubbles and post-entrapment crystallization). They are more hydrous than primary melts in the onshore Eastern Volcanic Zone and have parental CO2/Nb (≤590) at the upper end of regional estimates. Saturation pressures calculated from corrected CO2 values indicate that melts in both inclusion types initially crystallized at similar depths in the upper mantle (17–21 km), and then partially crystallized during ascent through the lower crust (7–13 km). Historical data show that gases emitted on Surtsey shifted from being relatively reduced in 1964/1965 to more oxidized in 1967, after a protracted period of effusive activity and resurgence of pyroclastic activity from satellite vents. Closed-system degassing models predict the compositions and redox states of the 1964/1965 gases extremely well, but cannot account for the oxidized gases emitted in 1967, which may have been contaminated by ambient air in a system that was opening as the eruption waned. Surtsey’s pyroclastic resurgence can be explained by recharge from ephemeral and compositionally heterogeneous magma bodies, tapped from possibly as deep as the mantle-crust boundary, in a process consistent with the progressively increasing interconnection between magma bodies that is typical at propagating rift tips. The eruption of Surtsey therefore shows that magma system evolution at rift tips can occur in dynamic and discrete events, with influx of new magma having explosive consequences.",,"[""Degassing"",""Iceland"",""Melt inclusion"",""Redox state"",""Rift propagation"",""Surtsey"",""Vapor bubbles"",""Volatile""]",10.1007/s00445-016-1025-4,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962019967,,0

We collected diverse biophysical data to allow spatial variability of soil organic carbon and factors contributing to this variation to be determined statistically, and used well established simulation models to interpret the data, predict long-term carbon dynamics and determine the potential for improvements in soil quality and mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. The spatial variation in soil organic carbon in the 0-20 cm soil depth was significant across study areas (P<0.01, 21.6 g kg-1-37.8 g kg-1), and between land-uses (P<0.05, 27.9 g kg-1 in cropland and 43.0 g kg-1 soil in forestland). In a multiple linear regression model, among the 11 explanatory variables used, four (total nitrogen, shrubs, trees and land use) showed a significant positive effect (P<0.01), while three (impact of grazing, impact of erosion and clay) showed a significant negative effect (P<0.01). Simulations using the assumption of steady state to estimate carbon dynamics suggested that plant inputs from croplands are generally lower than grass or shrublands, resulting in build-up of recalcitrant organic matter in shrublands compared to grass or croplands. Erosion results in a decline in both the absolute and relative amounts of carbon in recalcitrant pools, but the more active pools remained unchanged, meaning that the overall activity of soil organic matter is increased when the soil is eroded, and it becomes more difficult to sequester soil carbon. More rapid decrease in soil organic carbon is likely to be due to increased erosion, persistent removal of organic materials, grazing pressures, and higher rate of decompositions in cropland and grazing land-uses. Conversion to shrubland shows high potential to quickly restore eroded soils and build up a pool of recalcitrant soil carbon, suggesting that management of land using periodic 20 year exclosures, preventing cropping and grazing and allowing shrubland succession, could be beneficial in restoring degraded soils. Simulations using a calibration approach, rather than assuming steady state, corroborated these findings, suggesting that after 30 years of current management, croplands will deplete soil organic carbon by 5.6, 7.1 and 7.2 tha-1, and grasslands by 3.5, 3.9 and 2.7 tha-1, while shrublands will build-up soil organic carbon by 0.6, 0.1 and 1.3 tha-1 at study sites. At one study site, forests, will further increase soil organic carbon by 6.7 tha-1 after 30 years. The significant positive impact of shrubs and trees on soil organic carbon suggests the need to focus on introduction of agroforestry systems in crop and grasslands.",,"[""Simulated soil organic carbon"",""Soil organic carbon depletion"",""Soil organic carbon stock"",""Spatial and temporal dynamics of soil organic carbon stocks""]",10.1016/j.agee.2015.11.019,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949467274,,0

Risk factors for MCC are reported to include high age, UV exposure, Caucasian skin type and immunosuppression. The incidence is reported to be increasing. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe a Swedish cohort and calculate incidence. Methods: The study design is a retrospective cohort study of population-based data for MCC collected by the Swedish Cancer Registry to determine the incidence of MCC in Sweden and the clinical characteristics of these tumours including demographics, TNM classification, body part distribution and overall survival after diagnosis. De-identified data were collected from 1993 to 2012. Results: A total of 606 cases of MCC were identified during the study period. The median age was 81 years (range 21–99) and a majority, 54.4% were women but age-adjusted incidence is higher in men. The incidence (per 100,000) of MCC in Sweden in 1993–2012 increased from 0.09 to 0.20 for men and 0.12–0.17 for women, adjusted for age to the world standard population. For the both sexes, the increase was from 0.11 to 0.19 per 100 000, an increase of 73%. The most common site of the primary tumour was the head and neck, with 51.8% of the cases. The size of the tumour was <5 cm in 82.1% of the cases. The majority of the tumours (90.7%) had no known lymphatic spread and only a few patients had confirmed distant metastases (2.9%) when diagnosed. Conclusions: MCC is a rare disease in Sweden, but the incidence is increasing. This study supports the finding that high age, male sex and UV exposure are risk factors for MCCs. Interventions are required to increase awareness of MCC among clinicians and the public.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Carcinoma, Merkel Cell"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Incidence"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Sweden"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1111/jdv.13698,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991624888,,0

The rodent serum orthologue of human L-ficolin, ficolin-A, can bind to and opsonize Aspergillus fumigatus, the pathogen that causes invasive aspergillosis, and may participate in fungal defence. Using human monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils isolated from healthy donors, we investigated conidial association and fungal viability by flow cytometry and microscopy. Additionally, cytokine production was measured via cytometric bead arrays. Ficolin-A opsonization was observed to significantly enhance association of conidia, while also inhibiting hyphal growth and contributing to increased fungal killing following incubation with monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils. Additionally, ficolin-A opsonization was capable of manifesting a decrease in IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α production from MDM and IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α from neutrophils 24 h post-infection. In conclusion, rodent ficolin-A is functionally comparable to human L-ficolin and is capable of modulating the innate immune response to A. fumigatus, down-regulating cytokine production and could play an important role in airway immunity.","[""Aspergillosis"",""Aspergillus fumigatus"",""Cytokines"",""Host-Pathogen Interactions"",""Humans"",""Inflammation Mediators"",""Lectins"",""Leukocytes"",""Macrophages"",""Microbial Viability"",""Neutrophils""]","[""Aspergillosis"",""Cytokines"",""Innate immunity"",""Macrophage"",""Neutrophil""]",10.1007/s00430-015-0435-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961149433,http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/1988/3/Bidula_2015_Medical_Microbio_Immunol.pdf,0

This lack of priority results in inadequate and unbalanced food intake in patients and huge amounts of wasted food. Objectives: We evaluate the main factors that are associated with reduced meal intake in hospitalized patients and the differences between geographical regions. Design: We conducted a descriptive analysis of data from 9 consecutive, annual, and cross-sectional nutritionDay samples (2006-2014) in a total of 91,245 adult patients in 6668 wards in 2584 hospitals in 56 countries. A general estimation equation methodology was used to develop a model for meal intake, and P-value thresholding was used for model selection. Results: The proportion of patients who ate a full meal varied widely (24.7-61.5%) across world regions. The factors that were most strongly associated with reduced food intake on nutritionDay were reduced intake during the previous week (OR: 0.20; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.22), confinement to bed (OR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.55), female sex (OR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.5, 0.56), younger age (OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.64, 0.85) and older age (OR: 0.80; 95% CI: 0.74; 0.88), and low body mass index (OR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.90). The pattern of associated factors was homogenous across world regions. Conclusions: A set of factors that are associated with full meal intake was identified and is applicable to patients hospitalized in any region of the world.

The value of the resulting forests for biodiversity conservation is widely unknown, particularly in relation to highly diverse invertebrate taxa that fulfil important ecosystem services. We aimed to address this knowledge gap, establishing the conservation value of secondary forests on Dongling Mountain, North China based on the diversity of geometrid moths - a species-rich family of nocturnal pollinators that also influences plant assemblages through caterpillar herbivory. Results showed that secondary forests harboured geometrid moth assemblages similar in species richness and phylogenetic diversity, but with a species composition distinctly different to assemblages in one of China's last remaining mature temperate forests in the Changbaishan Nature Reserve. Species overlap between these sites was about 30%, and species did not form separate phylogenetic clusters according to site. Species assemblages at Dongling Mountain were strongly differentiated according to forest type; a pattern not found at Changbaishan. Our results indicate that protected naturally regenerated secondary forests in northern China provide suitable habitats for species-rich and genetically diverse geometrid moth assemblages, highlighting the potential importance of these forests for conservation and ecosystem function provision across the wider landscape.","[""Changbaishan"",""Donglingshan"",""Lepidoptera"",""Mature forest"",""Phylogenetic diversity""]","[""Changbaishan"",""Donglingshan"",""Lepidoptera"",""Mature forest"",""Phylogenetic diversity""]",10.1016/j.foreco.2016.04.054,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966453565,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1495975/1/ZouYi%20FEM.pdf,0

The principal therapeutic goal in managing VVA is to relieve symptoms as well as to restore the vaginal environment to a healthy state. However, despite its high prevalence and negative impact on quality of life, VVA is underreported by women, underrecognized by gynecologists, and therefore, undertreated. In the light of the new development of treatment options for VVA, we here provide an updated expert opinion on the management of VVA. In particular, we strongly recommend that HCPs proactively start an open discussion with their postmenopausal patients about urogenital symptoms. Treatment should be started as early as the first symptoms of VVA occur and should be maintained over time, due to the chronicity of the conditions. Many treatment options are now available and therapy should be individualized, taking the woman’s preference in consideration.","[""Atrophy"",""Estrogens"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Postmenopause"",""Vaginal Diseases"",""Vulvar Diseases""]","[""Diagnosis"",""expert opinion"",""management"",""vulvovaginal atrophy"",""VVA""]",10.1080/09513590.2016.1183627,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995555396,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09513590.2016.1183627?needAccess=true,0

However, scientific evidence for the effectiveness of this model of care remains limited, and there are few studies reporting on patients' perceptions of the care provided. The purpose of this study was to evaluate patients' perceived quality of care in a physiotherapist-led orthopaedic triage in primary care, compared with standard practice. Methods: In a randomised controlled trial, patients of working age referred for orthopaedic consultation at a primary healthcare clinic in Sweden received either physiotherapist-led triage (n = 102) or standard practice (orthopaedic surgeon assessment) (n = 101). Neither subjects nor clinicians were blinded. The questionnaire Quality from the Patient's Perspective (QPP) was used to evaluate perceived quality of care focusing on the caregivers' medical-technical competence and identity-orientated approach. Also, to what extent patients' expectations were met, and their intention to follow advice was evaluated. Results: For this study, 163 patients (80 %) were analysed (physiotherapist-led triage (n = 83), standard practice (n = 80)). Participants perceived significantly higher quality of care with the triage than with the standard practice in regards to receiving best possible examination and treatment (medical-technical competence) (p < 0.001). This was also found in regards to receiving information about examination and treatment (p < 0.001), results (p < 0.001), and self-care (p < 0.001), the caregiver's understanding (p < 0.001), respect (p < 0.001) and commitment (p < 0.001) as well as the opportunity to participate in decision-making (p = 0.01) (identity-orientated approach). Participants in the physiotherapist-led triage group reported to a significantly higher extent that their expectations of the treatment were met (p < 0.001), as well as the intent to follow the advice and instructions received (p = 0.019). Conclusions: This paper reports on patients' perceptions of quality of care in a physiotherapist-led orthopaedic triage compared with standard practice. Patients in both groups reported that they perceived good quality of care, with the patients in the physiotherapist-led triage reporting significantly higher perceived quality of care than those in the standard practice group. This model of care seems to meet patients' expectations and result in a greater intention to follow advice and instructions for self-management. Our findings are in line with existing literature that this model of care provides an opportunity to shape patient-centered care that can improve access and offer care on the most appropriate level, with maintained good quality of care.

Using the fan mussel, Atrina fragilis (Pennant 1777), as our case species, the aim of the study was to predict new areas of occurrence for A. fragilis, estimate the extent of potentially suitable areas, determine the proportion of these areas that are included in the recently designated nature conservation MPAs off the west of Scotland and identify possible environmental drivers in the distribution of A. fragilis. Location: West coast of Scotland, UK. Methods: Using a point process framework, we modelled presence-only data, including historic records. A quadrat survey employing digital still photography was conducted in areas of high and low suitability to verify the model, and subsequently, a targeted survey was undertaken in areas predicted as highly suitable by the models using towed video cameras. Results: Five environmental variables were of prime importance in explaining the distribution of A. fragilis. The results from the verification survey support model performance. Atrina fragilis was found in 80% of the targeted transects undertaken. Approximately 14% of the total area predicted as suitable for A. fragilis occurred within recently designated marine protected areas (MPAs) indicating considerable potential for recolonization given suitable protection. Main conclusions: The verified model suggests that limited presence-only and historical records of rare species can perform well within a SDM framework allowing the identification of further suitable areas. The prominence of bathymetric ruggedness in the models is unexpected, given the understood ecological niche for A. fragilis and pinnids in general, but is consistent with the fact that seabed topography can offer protection from fishing pressure.

Cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC) is the reported treatment with the longest survival. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of perioperative systemic chemotherapy strategies on survival and postoperative outcomes in patients with DMPM treated with curative intent with CRS-HIPEC, using a multi-institutional database: the French RENAPE network. Patients and methods From 1991 to 2014, 126 DMPM patients underwent CRS-HIPEC at 20 tertiary centres. The population was divided into four groups according to perioperative treatment: only neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NA), only adjuvant chemotherapy (ADJ), perioperative chemotherapy (PO) and no chemotherapy before or after CRS-HIPEC (NoC). Results All groups (NA: n = 42; ADJ: n = 16; PO: n = 16; NoC: n = 48) were comparable regarding clinicopathological data and main DMPM prognostic factors. After a median follow-up of 61 months, the 5-year overall survival (OS) was 40%, 67%, 62% and 56% in NA, ADJ, PO and NoC groups, respectively (P = 0.049). Major complications occurred for 41%, 45%, 35% and 41% of patients from NA, ADJ, PO and NoC groups, respectively (P = 0.299). In multivariate analysis, NA was independently associated with worse OS (hazard ratio, 2.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.07–4.94; P = 0.033). Conclusion This retrospective study suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy may delay recurrence and improve survival and that NA may impact negatively the survival for patients with DMPM who underwent CRS-HIPEC with curative intent.

The mechanism and process by which the slab materials are incorporated, however, are still uncertain. Here, we report, to our knowledge, the first set of Mg isotopic data for a suite of arc lava samples from Martinique Island in the Lesser Antilles arc, which displays one of the most extreme geochemical and isotopic ranges, although the origin of this variability is still highly debated. We find the δ26 Mg of the Martinique Island lavas varies from -0.25 to -0.10, in contrast to the narrow range that characterizes the mantle (-0.25 ± 0.04, 2 SD). These high aδ26 Mg values suggest the incorporation of isotopically heavy Mg from the subducted slab. The large contrast in MgO content between peridotite, basalt, and sediment makes direct mixing between sediment and peridotite, or assimilation by arc crust sediment, unlikely to be the main mechanism to modify Mg isotopes. Instead, the heavy Mg isotopic signature of the Martinique arc lavas requires that the overall composition of the mantle wedge is buffered and modified by the preferential addition of heavy Mg isotopes from fluids released from the altered subducted slab during fluid-mantle interaction.

Their very similar morphology has been responsible for the misidentification of the two organisms, and, consequently, for the underestimation of their geographic distributions and new areas of co-occurrence. In spite of the large amount of knowledge built up by developmental biologists, few data are available regarding the morpho-physiology of the two sea squirts. The comparison of morphological and physiological features carried out in the present study (i.e. length-body weight correlation, tunic/organ ratio, tissue-specific retained water and metabolic rate), highlighted slight, but significant, differences strongly supporting the hypothesis of different ecological strategies for the two species. More precisely, C. savignyi invests more energy in growing faster and taller, likely to improve the quality and concentration of the filtered food, and sustains a faster metabolic/growth rate. Conversely, C. robusta invests more into tunic thickness, reducing the risk of predation, even if this likely means a slower metabolic/growth rate. In addition it was noted that in both species, the tunic absorbs more water than the other tissues, a peculiarity that may allow them to better counteract sudden fluctuations in environmental salinity.",,"[""Ascidians"",""Ecology"",""Metabolic rate"",""Morphophysiology"",""Sea squirt"",""Tunic""]",10.1016/j.jembe.2016.09.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84987881585,,0

This improves the network lifetime, but can introduce uncertainty in the signal reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a two-layer controller that ensures efficient signal reconstruction (i.e., low level of reconstruction error) and high network lifetime. The proposed controller is composed of a global controller, developed at the fusion center layer, and two local controllers, implemented at each node layer. The former steers the RSCS reconstruction error to a desired value, while the latter are implemented to reduce the energy consumption of each node. A performance evaluation of the proposed scheme is carried out in terms of reconstruction error regulation and network lifetime. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme compared with two main strategies existing in the literature.","[""Compression algorithms"",""Compressive sensing"",""Global controllers"",""Monitoring applications"",""Network lifetime"",""Performance evaluation"",""Reconstruction error"",""Two-layer controllers""]","[""Compressive Sensing"",""Monitoring application"",""Network Lifetime"",""Performance evaluation"",""Random Sampling Compressive Sensing"",""Wireless Sensor Networks""]",10.1109/JSEN.2015.2507865,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962163493,,0

Poor experimental design and lack of transparent reporting can result in conscious or unconscious experimental bias, producing results that are not replicable. The Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration sponsored a consensus meeting of the Preclinical Pain Research Consortium for Investigating Safety and Efficacy (PPRECISE) Working Group. International participants from universities, funding agencies, government agencies, industry, and a patient advocacy organization attended. Reduction of publication bias, increasing the ability of others to faithfully repeat experimental methods, and increased transparency of data reporting were specifically discussed. Parameters deemed essential to increase confidence in the published literature were clear, specific reporting of an a priori hypothesis and definition of primary outcome measure. Power calculations and whether measurement of minimal meaningful effect size to determine these should be a core component of the preclinical research effort provoked considerable discussion, with many but not all agreeing. Greater transparency of reporting should be driven by scientists, journal editors, reviewers, and grant funders. The conduct of high-quality science that is fully reported should not preclude novelty and innovation in preclinical pain research, and indeed, any efforts that curtail such innovation would be misguided. We believe that to achieve the goal of finding effective new treatments for patients with pain, the pain field needs to deal with these challenging issues.","[""Analgesics"",""Bias (Epidemiology)"",""Evidence-Based Medicine"",""Humans"",""Pain"",""Research Design""]","[""Bias"",""Consensus"",""Internal validity"",""Transparent reporting""]",10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000458,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973308367,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4794131?pdf=render,0

The contemporary Maoist movement in India has been informed by a stated commitment to ‘progressive’ gender politics and social transformations; in that it marks a departure from the Naxalite movement of the 60s and 70s. Yet women remain concentrated in the group’s lower ranks and are absent from leadership positions. In addition, sexual and gender based violence and discrimination within the movement further undermine the commitment of the revolution to create opportunities for transformative politics including gender justice and equality. We consider it important that women’s lived experiences of the conflict - as combatants, supporters as well as civilians affected by it - are brought to the foreground. Drawing from postcolonial feminist approaches, we reflect on the challenges and possibilities for feminist politics and ethics within the Indian Maoist movement. We conclude that the rhetoric and reality of gender equality within the Maoist movement provides a unique opportunity to further investigate and analyze the ways in which feminist activism and the women’s movement in India have alienated the concerns of marginalized women from dalit and adivasi communities.",,"[""CPI-Maoist"",""India"",""Maoist insurgency"",""postcolonial feminism"",""Postcolonial State""]",10.1080/13688790.2016.1317397,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021746642,,0

A novel α–RHA activity was identified in the crude extract of Novosphingobium sp. PP1Y, a marine bacterium able to grow on a wide range of aromatic polycyclic compounds. In this work, this α-RHA activity was isolated from the native microorganism and the corresponding orf was identified in the completely sequenced and annotated genome of strain PP1Y. The coding gene was expressed in Escherichia coli, strain BL21(DE3), and the recombinant protein, rRHA-P, was purified and characterized as an inverting monomeric glycosidase of ca. 120 kDa belonging to the GH106 family. A biochemical characterization of this enzyme using pNPR as substrate was performed, which showed that rRHA-P had a moderate tolerance to organic solvents, a significant thermal stability up to 45 °C and a catalytic efficiency, at pH 6.9, significantly higher than other bacterial α-RHAs described in literature. Moreover, rRHA-P was able to hydrolyze natural glycosylated flavonoids (naringin, rutin, neohesperidin dihydrochalcone) containing α-L-rhamnose bound to β-D-glucose with either α-1,2 or α-1,6 glycosidic linkages.

The task is complicated by the number of interlinked factors to be taken into account, such as social impacts, drainage systems, marine currents and the ecosystems involved. This interdisciplinary volume presents a comprehensive blueprint for managing a sea. Focused on the Baltic Sea, it employs a range of methods and techniques, including nutrient budgets and simulation models, Geographical Information Systems (GIS), economic valuation and policy analysis, to arrive at an assessment of causes and consequences of pollution in the sea and the management of its resources. From the analysis of data on land use, population, costs of nutrient reductions and associated impacts, it presents significant and highly practical empirical and policy results. It diagnoses the causes of marine degradation, identifies through the use of simulation models cost-effective strategies for remediation and sets out the policies to be pursued collectively by the countries around the sea to restore and manage their common resource.

It has also been showed that behavioral misuse complicates substance abuse treatment, and that clients with such co-occurring difficulties have considerable treatment needs. Methodology: This study is based on interviews with six clients in substance abuse treatment, who also had a history of behavioral misuse. The interviews concerned the participants’ perception of their behavioral misuse and of themselves, and were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings and clinical implications: The participants perceived behavioral misuse as an escape from self-criticism and experiences of non-coherence. They also perceived relations and affects as overwhelming. Through behavioral misuse, relational and affective needs, as well as distressing self-experiences, were mitigated. The participants also described the efforts they had made to comprehend themselves. Their experiences were interpreted with respect to dissociation and concretization.

In this study, three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were exposed to 0, 4.6, 22, 82 and 271 μg/L diclofenac in flow-through systems for 28 days using triplicate aquaria per concentration. At the highest concentration, significant mortalities were observed already after 21 days (no mortalities found up to 22 μg/L). Histological analysis revealed a significant increase in the proportion of renal hematopoietic tissue (renal hematopoietic hyperplasia) after 28 days at the lowest concentration and at all higher concentrations, following a clear dose-response pattern. Skin ulcerations of the jaw were noted by macroscopic observations, primarily at the two highest concentrations. No histological changes were observed in the liver.

This treatment is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. Therefore, improvement of patient selection is necessary. Assuming that the clinical phenotype is dictated by biological mechanisms, biomarkers could play a crucial role in this process. Since it is unknown whether and to what extent angiogenesis influences the course of disease in patients with PM, we investigated the expression of two angiogenesis-related markers and their relation to overall survival (OS) in CRC patients after CRS and HIPEC. Clinicopathological data and tissue samples were collected from 65 CRC patients with isolated metastases to the peritoneum that underwent CRS and HIPEC. Whole tissue specimens from PM were evaluated for versican (VCAN) expression, VEGF expression and microvessel density (MVD) by immunohistochemistry. The relation between these markers and OS was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. Associations between VEGF expression, VCAN expression, MVD and clinicopathological data were tested. High stromal VCAN expression was associated with high MVD (p = 0.001), better resection outcome (p = 0.003) and high T-stage (p = 0.027). High epithelial VCAN expression was associated with MVD (p = 0.007) and a more complete resection (p < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, simplified peritoneal cancer index (p = 0.001), VEGF expression levels (p = 0.012), age (p = 0.030), epithelial VCAN expression levels (p = 0.042) and lymph node status (p = 0.053) were associated with OS.

Previous results showed that at higher concentrations, the PUA decadienal induced apoptosis on copepods and sea urchin embryos via caspase-3 activation; at lower concentrations decadienal affected the expression levels of the caspase-8 gene in embryos of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. In the present work, we studied the effects of other common oxylipins produced by diatoms: two PUAs (heptadienal and octadienal) and four hydroxyacids (5-, 9- 11- and 15-HEPE) on P. lividus cell death and caspase activities. Our results showed that (i) at higher concentrations PUAs and HEPEs induced apoptosis in sea urchin embryos, detected by microscopic observation and through the activation of caspase-3/7 and caspase-8 measured by luminescent assays; (ii) at low concentrations, PUAs and HEPEs affected the expression levels of caspase-8 and caspase-3/7 (isolated for the first time here in P. lividus) genes, detected by Real Time qPCR. These findings have interesting implications from the ecological point of view, given the importance of diatom blooms in nutrient-rich aquatic environments.","[""Animals"",""Apoptosis"",""Caspases"",""Diatoms"",""Embryo, Nonmammalian"",""Oxylipins"",""Paracentrotus"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Apoptosis"",""Caspases"",""Diatoms"",""Sea urchin""]",10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.04.012,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964296865,http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/23515/1/Ruocco%20et%20al%20%282016%29%20Aquatic%20Toxicology..pdf,0

Here, we use GPS and morphological observations from southern Mexico to explore potential mechanical links between variations in inter-SSE (in between slow slip events) coupling along the Mexico subduction zone and the long-term topography of the coastal regions from Guerrero to Oaxaca. Inter-SSE coupling solutions for two different geometries of the subduction interface are derived from an inversion of continuous GPS time series corrected from slow slip events. They reveal strong along-strike variations in the shallow coupling (i.e. at depths down to 25 km), with high-coupling zones (coupling >0.7) alternating with low-coupling zones (coupling <0.3). Coupling below the continent is typically strong (>0.7) and transitions to uncoupled, steady slip at a relatively uniform ∼ 175-km inland from the trench. Along-strike variations in the coast-to-trench distances are strongly correlated with the GPS-derived forearc coupling variations. To explore a mechanical explanation for this correlation, we apply Coulomb wedge theory, constrained by local topographic, bathymetric, and subducting-slab slopes. Critical state areas, i.e. areas where the inner subduction wedge deforms, are spatially correlated with transitions at shallow depth between uncoupled and coupled areas of the subduction interface. Two end-member models are considered to explain the correlation between coast-to-trench distances and along-strike variations in the inter-SSE coupling. The first postulates that the inter-SSE elastic strain is partitioned between slip along the subduction interface and homogeneous plastic permanent deformation of the upper plate. In the second, permanent plastic deformation is postulated to depend on frictional transitions along the subduction plate interface. Based on the location and friction values of the critical state areas identified by our Coulomb wedge analysis, we parameterise frictional transitions in plastic-static models of deformation over several seismic cycles. This predicts strong shear dissipation above frictional transitions on the subduction interface. The comparison of modelled surface displacements over a critical zone at a frictional transition and over a stable area with no internal wedge deformation shows differences of long-term uplift consistent with the observed along-strike variations in the coast-to-trench distances. Our work favours a model in which frictional asperities partly control short-term inter-SSE coupling as measured by geodesy and in which those asperities persist through time.","[""Coastal morphology"",""critical taper theory"",""Geodetic measurements"",""Long-term deformation"",""Middle America trenches"",""Morphological observations"",""Permanent deformations"",""Surface displacement""]","[""coastal morphology"",""critical taper theory"",""global positioning system"",""inter-SSE coupling"",""Middle America Trench"",""plastic deformation""]",10.1007/s00024-015-1215-6,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991011432,,0

Here, we examine European perch (Perca fluviatilis, L.) from the Biotest enclosure, a unique coastal ecosystem that maintains natural thermal fluctuations but has been warmed by 5-10°C by a nuclear power plant for over three decades. We show that Biotest perch grow faster and display thermally compensated resting cardiorespiratory functions compared with reference perch living at natural temperatures in adjacent waters. However, maximum cardiorespiratory capacities and heat tolerance limits exhibit limited or no thermal compensation when compared with acutely heated reference perch. We propose that while basal energy requirements and resting cardiorespiratory functions (floors) are thermally plastic, maximum capacities and upper critical heat limits (ceilings) are much less flexible and thus will limit the adaptive capacity of fishes in a warming climate.","[""Animals"",""Construction Materials"",""Geography"",""Global Warming"",""Heart"",""Lung"",""Perches"",""Plastics"",""Rest""]",,10.1038/ncomms11447,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968756805,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11447.pdf,0

We focused on thirty-nine elements including rare earths. For most of them, moss uptake was higher in agricultural than in urban scenarios and in front road sites. Twenty PAHs were analyzed in a subset of agricultural sites; 4- and 5-ringed PAHs were the most abundant, particularly chrysene, fluoranthene and pyrene. Overall results indicated that investigated pollutants have a similar spatial distribution pattern over the entire study area, with road traffic and agricultural practices as the major diffuse pollution sources. Moss bags proved a very sensitive tool, able to discriminate between different land use scenarios and proximity to roads in a mixed rural-urban landscape.","[""Agricultural practices"",""Atmospheric depositions"",""Atmospheric pollution"",""Fragmented landscapes"",""Hypnum cupressiforme"",""Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS)"",""Spatial distribution patterns"",""Urban sprawl"",""Air Pollutants"",""Atmosphere"",""Bryophyta"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Metals"",""Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons""]","[""Atmospheric deposition"",""Heavy metals"",""Hypnum cupressiforme"",""Moss transplants"",""PAHs"",""Urban sprawl""]",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.01.065,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960123853,,0

All rights reserved.To develop an internationally standardized protocol for the moss bag technique application, the research team participating in the FP7 European project ""MOSSclone"" focused on the optimization of the moss bags exposure in terms of bag characteristics (shape of the bags, mesh size, weight/surface ratio), duration and height of exposure by comparing traditional moss bags to a new concept bag, ""Mossphere"". In particular, the effects of each variable on the metal uptake from the air were evaluated by a systematic experimental design carried out in urban, industrial, agricultural and background areas of three European countries with oceanic, Mediterranean and continental climate. The results evidenced that the shape, the mesh size of the bags and the exposure height (in the tested ranges), did not significantly influence the uptake capacity of the transplanted moss. The aspects more affecting the element uptake were represented by the density of the moss inside the bags and the relative ratio between its weight and the surface area of the bag. We found that, the lower the density, the higher the uptake recorded. Moreover, three weeks of exposure were not enough to have a consistent uptake signal in all the environments tested, thus we suggest an exposure period not shorter than 6 weeks, which is appropriate in most situations. The above results were confirmed in all the countries and scenarios tested. The adoption of a shared exposure protocol by the research community is strongly recommended since it is a key aspect to make biomonitoring surveys directly comparable, also in view of its recognition as a monitoring method by the EU legislation.","[""Active biomonitoring"",""Continental climate"",""Moss bag techniques"",""Moss uptake"",""Mossphere"",""Pseudoscleropodium purum"",""Research communities"",""Systematic evaluation"",""Air Pollutants"",""Bryophyta"",""Climate"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Europe"",""Internationality"",""Metals""]","[""Active biomonitoring"",""Air pollution"",""Moss uptake"",""Mossphere"",""Pseudoscleropodium purum"",""Trace elements""]",10.1016/j.envpol.2016.04.043,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964344165,,0

The incidence is higher in less developed countries, where penile cancer can account for up to 10% of cancers among men in some parts of Africa, South America, and Asia. Objective To describe the human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA prevalence, HPV type distribution, and detection of markers of viral activity (ie, E6∗I mRNA and p16INK4a) in a series of invasive penile cancers and penile high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HGSILs) from 25 countries. A total of 85 penile HGSILs and 1010 penile invasive cancers diagnosed from 1983 to 2011 were included. Design, setting, and participants After histopathologic evaluation of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, HPV DNA detection and genotyping were performed using the SPF-10/DEIA/LiPA25 system, v.1 (Laboratory Biomedical Products, Rijswijk, The Netherlands). HPV DNA-positive cases were additionally tested for oncogene E6∗I mRNA and all cases for p16INK4a expression, a surrogate marker of oncogenic HPV activity. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis HPV DNA prevalence and type distributions were estimated. Results and limitations HPV DNA was detected in 33.1% of penile cancers (95% confidence interval [CI], 30.2-36.1) and in 87.1% of HGSILs (95% CI, 78.0-93.4). The warty-basaloid histologic subtype showed the highest HPV DNA prevalence. Among cancers, statistically significant differences in prevalence were observed only by geographic region and not by period or by age at diagnosis. HPV16 was the most frequent HPV type detected in both HPV-positive cancers (68.7%) and HGSILs (79.6%). HPV6 was the second most common type in invasive cancers (3.7%). The p16INK4a upregulation and mRNA detection in addition to HPV DNA positivity were observed in 69.3% of HGSILs, and at least one of these HPV activity markers was detected in 85.3% of cases. In penile cancers, these figures were 22.0% and 27.1%, respectively. Conclusions About a third to a fourth of penile cancers were related to HPV when considering HPV DNA detection alone or adding an HPV activity marker, respectively. The observed HPV type distribution reinforces the potential benefit of current and new HPV vaccines in the reduction of HPV-related penile neoplastic lesions. Patient summary About one-third to one-quarter of penile cancers were related to human papillomavirus (HPV).

Stratification represents a major process regulating the seasonal dynamics of bottom oxygen, yet, lowest oxygen conditions in the North Sea do not occur in the regions of strongest stratification. This suggests that stratification is an important prerequisite for oxygen deficiency, but that the complex interaction between hydrodynamics and the biological processes drives its evolution. <br><br> In this study we use the ecosystem model HAMSOM-ECOHAM to provide a general characterisation of the different zones of the North Sea with respect to oxygen, and to quantify the impact of the different physical and biological factors driving the oxygen dynamics inside the entire sub-thermocline volume and directly above the bottom. <br><br> With respect to oxygen dynamics, the North Sea can be subdivided into three different zones: (1) a highly productive, non-stratified coastal zone, (2) a productive, seasonally stratified zone with a small sub-thermocline volume, and (3) a productive, seasonally stratified zone with a large sub-thermocline volume. Type 2 reveals the highest susceptibility to oxygen deficiency due to sufficiently long stratification periods (&gt; ĝ€60 days) accompanied by high surface productivity resulting in high biological consumption, and a small sub-thermocline volume implying both a small initial oxygen inventory and a strong influence of the biological consumption on the oxygen concentration. <br><br> Year-to-year variations in the oxygen conditions are caused by variations in primary production, while spatial differences can be attributed to differences in stratification and water depth. The large sub-thermocline volume dominates the oxygen dynamics in the northern central and northern North Sea and makes this region insusceptible to oxygen deficiency. In the southern North Sea the strong tidal mixing inhibits the development of seasonal stratification which protects this area from the evolution of low oxygen conditions. In contrast, the southern central North Sea is highly susceptible to low oxygen conditions (type 2). <br><br> We furthermore show that benthic diagenetic processes represent the main oxygen consumers in the bottom layer, consistently accounting for more than 50ĝ€% of the overall consumption. Thus, primary production followed by remineralisation of organic matter under stratified conditions constitutes the main driver for the evolution of oxygen deficiency in the southern central North Sea. By providing these valuable insights, we show that ecosystem models can be a useful tool for the interpretation of observations and the estimation of the impact of anthropogenic drivers on the North Sea oxygen conditions.",,,10.5194/bg-13-2511-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966705146,https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/2511/2016/bg-13-2511-2016.pdf,0

Here we explore how declining pH and carbonate saturation may affect the structural complexity of four major biogenic habitats. Our analyses predict that indirect effects driven by OA on habitat-forming organisms could lead to lower species diversity in coral reefs, mussel beds and some macroalgal habitats, but increases in seagrass and other macroalgal habitats. Available in situ data support the prediction of decreased biodiversity in coral reefs, but not the prediction of seagrass bed gains. Thus, OA-driven habitat loss may exacerbate the direct negative effects of OA on coastal biodiversity; however, we lack evidence of the predicted biodiversity increase in systems where habitat-forming species could benefit from acidification. Overall, a combination of direct effects and community-mediated indirect effects will drive changes in the extent and structural complexity of biogenic habitat, which will have important ecosystem effects.",,,10.1038/nclimate3161,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85008343620,http://plymsea.ac.uk/id/eprint/8847/1/Biogenic%20habitat%20and%20OA%20-%20Preprint.pdf,0

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY license.Background Established in 2000, Millennium Development Goal 4 (MDG4) catalysed extraordinary political, financial, and social commitments to reduce under-5 mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015. At the country level, the pace of progress in improving child survival has varied markedly, highlighting a crucial need to further examine potential drivers of accelerated or slowed decreases in child mortality. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides an analytical framework to comprehensively assess these trends for under-5 mortality, age-specific and cause-specific mortality among children under 5 years, and stillbirths by geography over time. Methods Drawing from analytical approaches developed and refined in previous iterations of the GBD study, we generated updated estimates of child mortality by age group (neonatal, post-neonatal, ages 1–4 years, and under 5) for 195 countries and territories and selected subnational geographies, from 1980–2015. We also estimated numbers and rates of stillbirths for these geographies and years. Gaussian process regression with data source adjustments for sampling and non-sampling bias was applied to synthesise input data for under-5 mortality for each geography. Age-specific mortality estimates were generated through a two-stage age–sex splitting process, and stillbirth estimates were produced with a mixed-effects model, which accounted for variable stillbirth definitions and data source-specific biases. For GBD 2015, we did a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in child mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and annualised rates of decrease for under-5 mortality and stillbirths as they related to the Soci-demographic Index (SDI). Second, we examined the ratio of recorded and expected levels of child mortality, on the basis of SDI, across geographies, as well as differences in recorded and expected annualised rates of change for under-5 mortality. Third, we analysed levels and cause compositions of under-5 mortality, across time and geographies, as they related to rising SDI. Finally, we decomposed the changes in under-5 mortality to changes in SDI at the global level, as well as changes in leading causes of under-5 deaths for countries and territories. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 child mortality estimation process, as well as data sources, in accordance with the Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, 5·8 million (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 5·7–6·0) children younger than 5 years died in 2015, representing a 52·0% (95% UI 50·7–53·3) decrease in the number of under-5 deaths since 1990. Neonatal deaths and stillbirths fell at a slower pace since 1990, decreasing by 42·4% (41·3–43·6) to 2·6 million (2·6–2·7) neonatal deaths and 47·0% (35·1–57·0) to 2·1 million (1·8-2·5) stillbirths in 2015. Between 1990 and 2015, global under-5 mortality decreased at an annualised rate of decrease of 3·0% (2·6–3·3), falling short of the 4·4% annualised rate of decrease required to achieve MDG4. During this time, 58 countries met or exceeded the pace of progress required to meet MDG4. Between 2000, the year MDG4 was formally enacted, and 2015, 28 additional countries that did not achieve the 4·4% rate of decrease from 1990 met the MDG4 pace of decrease. However, absolute levels of under-5 mortality remained high in many countries, with 11 countries still recording rates exceeding 100 per 1000 livebirths in 2015. Marked decreases in under-5 deaths due to a number of communicable diseases, including lower respiratory infections, diarrhoeal diseases, measles, and malaria, accounted for much of the progress in lowering overall under-5 mortality in low-income countries. Compared with gains achieved for infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies, the persisting toll of neonatal conditions and congenital anomalies on child survival became evident, especially in low-income and low-middle-income countries. We found sizeable heterogeneities in comparing observed and expected rates of under-5 mortality, as well as differences in observed and expected rates of change for under-5 mortality. At the global level, we recorded a divergence in observed and expected levels of under-5 mortality starting in 2000, with the observed trend falling much faster than what was expected based on SDI through 2015. Between 2000 and 2015, the world recorded 10·3 million fewer under-5 deaths than expected on the basis of improving SDI alone. Interpretation Gains in child survival have been large, widespread, and in many places in the world, faster than what was anticipated based on improving levels of development. Yet some countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, still had high rates of under-5 mortality in 2015. Unless these countries are able to accelerate reductions in child deaths at an extraordinary pace, their achievement of proposed SDG targets is unlikely. Improving the evidence base on drivers that might hasten the pace of progress for child survival, ranging from cost-effective intervention packages to innovative financing mechanisms, is vital to charting the pathways for ultimately ending preventable child deaths by 2030.

An in situ study was performed in the high Arctic (79°N) to determine the effect of high irradiances in general, and ultraviolet radiation (UVR, 280–400 nm) in particular, on cell concentrations, fatty acid composition, and photoprotective pigments of three diatom species isolated from seawater around Svalbard. Unialgal cultures were exposed in situ at 0.5- and 8 m-depth. After 40 h, cell concentrations of Synedropsis hyperborea and Thalassiosira sp., were lower at 0.5 than at 8 m, and the content of the photoprotective xanthophyll-cycle pigment diatoxanthin in all species (S. hyperborea, Thalassiosira sp., Porosira glacialis) was higher in the 0.5 m exposure compared to 8 m. In S. hyperborea, growth was additionally inhibited by UVR at 0.5-m depth. In situ radiation conditions led, furthermore, to a significant decrease in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in all three species, but UVR had no additional effect. Hence, we conclude that natural radiation conditions close to the surface could reduce growth and PUFA concentrations, but the effects are species specific. The diatoms’ potential to acclimate to these conditions over time has to be evaluated.",,"[""Arctic"",""Microalgae"",""PAR"",""PUFA"",""UVR"",""Xanthophyll cycle""]",10.1007/s00300-016-2003-1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84981288145,https://epic.awi.de/id/eprint/41797/1/2016_Leu-etal.pdf,0

All rights reserved.Background:The European Randomised Study of Prostate Cancer Screening has shown a 21% relative reduction in prostate cancer mortality at 13 years. The causes of death can be misattributed, particularly in elderly men with multiple comorbidities, and therefore accurate assessment of the underlying cause of death is crucial for valid results. To address potential unreliability of end-point assessment, and its possible impact on mortality results, we analysed the study outcome adjudication data in six countries.Methods:Latent class statistical models were formulated to compare the accuracy of individual adjudicators, and to assess whether accuracy differed between the trial arms. We used the model to assess whether correcting for adjudication inaccuracies might modify the study results.Results:There was some heterogeneity in adjudication accuracy of causes of death, but no consistent differential accuracy by trial arm. Correcting the estimated screening effect for misclassification did not alter the estimated mortality effect of screening.Conclusions:Our findings were consistent with earlier reports on the European screening trial. Observer variation, while demonstrably present, is unlikely to have materially biased the main study results. A bias in assigning causes of death that might have explained the mortality reduction by screening can be effectively ruled out.","[""Aged"",""Belgium"",""Cause of Death"",""Death Certificates"",""Early Detection of Cancer"",""Europe"",""Finland"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Male"",""Mass Screening"",""Middle Aged"",""Netherlands"",""Prostatic Neoplasms"",""Registries"",""Research Design"",""Statistics as Topic"",""Sweden"",""Switzerland""]",,10.1038/bjc.2016.378,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995752307,https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2016378.pdf,0

All rights reserved.Improvements in crop management for a more sustainable agriculture are fundamental to reduce environmental impacts of cropland and to mitigate effects on global climate change. In this study three fertilization types – ammonium nitrate (control); mineral fertilizer added with a nitrification inhibitor (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP)), and an organo-mineral fertilizer (OM) – were tested on a tomato crop in order to evaluate effects both on crop production and soil N2O emissions. Plants grown under OM fertilization had a greater relative growth rate compared to mineral fertilization, due to a higher net assimilation rate, which was related to a greater light interception rather than to a higher photosynthetic efficiency. OM fertilization determined the highest fruit production and lower soil N2O fluxes compared to NH4NO3, although the lowest soil N2O fluxes were found in response to mineral fertilizer added with a nitrification inhibitor. It can be concluded that organo-mineral fertilizer is a better nutrient source compared to mineral fertilizers able to improve crop yield and to mitigate soil N2O emission.",,"[""Emission factor"",""Mediterranean climate"",""Nitrous oxide"",""Plant growth""]",10.17221/678/2016-PSE,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017553397,https://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/678_2016-PSE.pdf,0

Based on Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) Theory, we examined a potential motivational process in which career competencies, as a personal resource, would enhance career success through expansive job crafting. The results showed that job crafting mediated the positive relationship between career competencies and both internal and external perceived employability. In addition, job crafting mediated the positive relationship between career competencies and work–home enrichment. We expected a negative association between job crafting and work–home interference, yet our results indicated that career competencies are indirectly and positively related to work–home interference via job crafting. With our findings, we add to JD-R Theory by (1) showing that career competencies may be considered a personal resource, (2) empirically examining the role of job crafting in motivational processes, and (3) showing that enhanced subjective career success can be an outcome of motivational processes.

We hypothesized that snails originating from a metal-contaminated habitat (B) would have increased tolerance to harbour contaminants (e.g. metals from antifouling paints), compared to snails originating from a relatively clean habitat (A). We assessed tolerance to metals in terms of survival and histopathological alterations after 2, 4 and 8 weeks of in situ exposure in three Baltic Sea boat harbours and three reference sites. We also hypothesized that any potential tolerance to contaminants would be associated with differences in genetic diversity between the two snail populations (evaluated as mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I, COI). The results show that snails from population A survived to a higher extent compared to population B, possibly indicating either a lack of adaptation to metals in snails B or impaired health condition due to contaminant pre-exposure or a higher resilience of snails A. Moreover, the genetic diversity of COI was low within each population and did not differ between populations. In general, 83% of all the types of histopathological alterations (e.g. lysis and necrosis of gonads and digestive gland or granulocytoma and phagocytosis in the storage tissue, among others) had a higher probability of occurrence among harbour-exposed snails compared to reference-exposed snails, regardless of snail population origin. The only significant difference in histological effects between the two populations was in the frequency of parasite infestations and shell fouling, both being larger for population A than B. Interestingly, the rate of parasite infestations was higher for males than females from population A, whereas no sexual dichotomy was observed for population B. Our results show that exposure to harbour contaminants causes both lethal and sublethal toxicity to snails, and the association between many of the toxic responses and metals substantiates that antifouling substances contribute to the observed effects, although there is a large proportion of variation in our data that remains unexplained.","[""Acclimatization"",""Animals"",""Ecosystem"",""Environmental Exposure"",""Genetic Variation"",""Male"",""Metals, Heavy"",""Snails"",""Survival Analysis"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Caging"",""COI"",""Histopathology"",""Metals"",""Snails"",""Theodoxus fluviatilis""]",10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.06.018,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021261628,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.06.018,0

The understanding of the drivers of these landscape changes remains challenging, partly because landscape research is spread across many domains and disciplines. We here provide a systematic synthesis of 144 studies that identify the proximate and underlying drivers of landscape change across Europe. First, we categorize how driving forces have been addressed and find that most studies consider medium-term time scales and local spatial scales. Most studies assessed only one case study area, one spatial scale, and less than four points in time. Second, we analyze geographical coverage of studies and reveal that countries with a non-European Union/European Free Trade Association membership; low Gross Domestic Product; boreal, steppic, and arctic landscapes; as well as forestland systems are underrepresented in the literature. Third, our review shows that land abandonment/extensification is the most prominent (62% of cases) among multiple proximate drivers of landscape change. Fourthly, we find that distinct combinations of mainly political/institutional, cultural, and natural/spatial underlying drivers are determining landscape change, rather than single key drivers. Our systematic review indicates knowledge gaps that can be filled by: (a) expanding the scope of studies to include underrepresented landscapes; (b) clarifying the identification and role of actors in landscape change; (c) deploying more robust tools and methods to quantitatively assess the causalities of landscape change; (d) setting up long-term studies that go beyond mapping land-cover change only; (e) strengthening cross-site and cross-country comparisons of landscape drivers; (f) designing multi-scale studies that consider teleconnections; (g) considering subtle and novel processes of landscape change.",,"[""Agricultural intensification"",""Europe"",""Land abandonment"",""Land use and land cover change"",""Proximate and underlying drivers"",""Urbanization""]",10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.04.040,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973481012,https://zenodo.org/record/345330/files/HERCULES_FP7_04_Plieninger_etal_2016_preprint.pdf,0

Both conditions are associated with significant disability and patients with CD face higher mortality rates compared to the general population. The increasing understanding of the immunological basis of the disease led to the introduction of biologic therapies targeting key pathways of the natural and adaptive immune response such as Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α) inhibitors and, more recently, integrin-receptor antagonists. Treatment with TNF-α inhibitors improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes for many patients who did not benefit from conventional therapy. However, a sizeable share of patients still face suboptimal outcomes due to primary or secondary therapy failure. With the introduction of VDZ, a biologic treatment targeting novel IBD-relevant biologic pathways, it is crucial to understand how to integrate such innovations into current clinical practice. To this end, a panel of 14 Italian experts in the management of IBD met for a roundtable discussion. Recommendations concerning the management of moderate-to-severe IBD based on experts' opinions and literature review are discussed in the present report.","[""Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized"",""Biological Therapy"",""Disease Management"",""Gastrointestinal Agents"",""Humans"",""Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"",""Practice Guidelines as Topic"",""Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"",""Severity of Illness Index"",""Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha""]","[""Crohn's Disease"",""Inflammatory Bowel Disease"",""Ulcerative Colitis"",""Vedolizumab""]",10.1016/j.dld.2015.12.016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960796928,,0

Due to the variability and unpredictability of added RES, reserve requirements will increase in the future. To counter this, adequate reserve sizing techniques are of major importance. While most system operators apply simple deterministic or probabilistic models assuming RES forecast errors to follow a Gaussian distribution, we propose an improved dynamic reserve sizing method using nonparametric distributions as a forecast error description. The added value of the presented methodology is the use of a conditional kernel-based estimator in combination with a clustering approach to derive dynamic reserves through a convolution of conditional load, wind and solar forecast errors, and plant outage distributions. For comparability, traditional static and deterministic approaches are applied. Based on recent historical data for the German power system, we quantify reserves and demonstrate the feasibility and economic benefits of this improved approach using a scheduling model.","[""Clustering"",""Kernel distribution"",""Power system model"",""Probabilistic reserves"",""Renewable energy source""]","[""Clustering"",""Kernel distribution"",""power system modeling"",""probabilistic reserve sizing"",""renewable energy sources"",""statistical analysis""]",10.1109/TSTE.2016.2555483,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988815639,,0

We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction caused by Chagas' disease, with other etiologies, in the era of modern HF therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 2552 Latin American patients randomized in the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) and ATMOSPHERE (Aliskiren Trial to Minimize Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure) trials. The investigator-reported etiology was categorized as Chagasic, other nonischemic, or ischemic cardiomyopathy. The outcomes of interest included the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and its components and death from any cause. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were performed to compare outcomes by pathogenesis. There were 195 patients with Chagasic HF with reduced ejection fraction, 1300 with other nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and 1057 with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Compared with other etiologies, Chagasic patients were more often female, younger, and had lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment (but had higher prevalence of stroke and pacemaker implantation) and had worse health-related quality of life. The rates of the composite outcome were 17.2, 12.5, and 11.4 per 100 person-years for Chagasic, other nonischemic, and ischemic patients, respectively-adjusted hazard ratio for Chagasic versus other nonischemic: 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.94; P=0.003) and Chagasic versus ischemic: 1.55 (1.18-2.04; P=0.002).

The present study aims at estimating the degree of blue whale exposure to shipping noise, in space and time, and the risks of auditory damages, behavioral responses and communication masking in this region. First, shipping noise radiated from the AIS-monitored traffic is modeled, mapped with a high time-space resolution, and validated using in situ measurements from a dedicated ANSI-compliant acoustic observatory along the seaway. The latter is also used to estimate the source levels of the ships.

Determining factors that govern growth of these primary producers, and how they interact, is therefore essential to understanding aquatic ecosystem productivity. Over half of microalgal species representing marine and freshwater habitats require for growth the corrinoid cofactor B12, which is synthesized de novo only by certain prokaryotes, including the majority of cyanobacteria. There are several chemical variants of B12, which are not necessarily functionally interchangeable. Cobalamin, the form bioavailable to humans, has as its lower axial ligand 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB). Here, we show that the abundant marine cyanobacterium Synechococcus synthesizes only pseudocobalamin, in which the lower axial ligand is adenine. Moreover, bioinformatic searches of over 100 sequenced cyanobacterial genomes for B12 biosynthesis genes, including those involved in nucleotide loop assembly, suggest this is the form synthesized by cyanobacteria more broadly. We further demonstrate that pseudocobalamin is several orders of magnitude less bioavailable than cobalamin to several B12-dependent microalgae representing diverse lineages. This indicates that the two major phytoplankton groups use a different B12 currency. However, in an intriguing twist, some microalgal species can use pseudocobalamin if DMB is provided, suggesting that they are able to remodel the cofactor, whereas Synechococcus cannot. This species-specific attribute implicates algal remodelers as novel and keystone players of the B12 cycle, transforming our perception of the dynamics and complexity of the flux of this nutrient in aquatic ecosystems.","[""Bacterial Proteins"",""Computational Biology"",""Fresh Water"",""Phytoplankton"",""Synechococcus"",""Vitamin B 12""]","[""algae"",""competition"",""cyanobacteria"",""nutrient cycling"",""phytoplankton"",""pseudocobalamin"",""Vitamin B12""]",10.1016/j.cub.2016.02.041,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962110257,http://www.cell.com/article/S0960982216301233/pdf,0

These clinical complications include metabolic syndrome, consisting of systemic arterial hypertension, visceral obesity, impairment of glucose metabolism, and dyslipidaemia; musculoskeletal disorders, such as myopathy, osteoporosis, and skeletal fractures; neuropsychiatric disorders, such as impairment of cognitive function, depression, or mania; impairment of reproductive and sexual function; and dermatological manifestations, mainly represented by acne, hirsutism, and alopecia. Hypertension in patients with Cushing's syndrome has a multifactorial pathogenesis and contributes to the increased risk for myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, or stroke, which are the most common causes of death; risks of these outcomes are exacerbated by a prothrombotic diathesis and hypokalaemia. Neuropsychiatric disorders can be responsible for suicide. Immune disorders are common; immunosuppression during active disease causes susceptibility to infections, possibly complicated by sepsis, an important cause of death, whereas immune rebound after disease remission can exacerbate underlying autoimmune diseases. Prompt treatment of cortisol excess and specific treatments of comorbidities are crucial to prevent serious clinical complications and reduce the mortality associated with Cushing's syndrome.","[""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Cushing Syndrome"",""Humans"",""Immune System Diseases"",""Mental Disorders"",""Metabolic Syndrome"",""Musculoskeletal Diseases"",""Sexual Dysfunction, Physiological""]",,10.1016/S2213-8587(16)00086-3,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84970015485,https://iris.uniroma1.it/retrieve/handle/11573/869810/281375/Pivonello_Complications-Cushing%e2%80%99s-syndrome_2016.pdf,0

Our objective was to quantify the risk associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in 2 urban areas using fine-scale air pollution modeling and to characterize how this risk varied according to social deprivation. In Grenoble and Lyon areas (0.4 and 1.2 million inhabitants, respectively) in 2012, PM2.5 exposure was estimated on a 10×10 m grid by coupling a dispersion model to population density. Outcomes were mortality, lung cancer and term low birth weight incidences. Cases attributable to air pollution were estimated overall and stratifying areas according to the European Deprivation Index (EDI), taking 10 μg/m3 yearly average as reference (counterfactual) level. Estimations were repeated assuming spatial homogeneity of air pollutants within urban area. Median PM2.5 levels were 18.1 and 19.6 μg/m3 in Grenoble and Lyon urban areas, respectively, corresponding to 114 (5.1% of total, 95% confidence interval, CI, 3.2-7.0%) and 491 non-accidental deaths (6.0% of total, 95% CI 3.7-8.3%) attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5, respectively. Attributable term low birth weight cases represented 23.6% of total cases (9.0-37.1%) in Grenoble and 27.6% of cases (10.7-42.6%) in Lyon. In Grenoble, 6.8% of incident lung cancer cases were attributable to air pollution (95% CI 3.1-10.1%). Risk was lower by 8 to 20% when estimating exposure through background stations. Risk was highest in neighborhoods with intermediate to higher social deprivation.

Acquiring this knowledge is challenging because it is difficult to obtain robust long-term data sets on endangered populations and, usually, data are collected through diverse sampling strategies. Integrated population models (IPMs) offer a way to integrate data generated through different processes. However, IPMs are female-based models that cannot account for mate availability, and this feature limits their applicability to monogamous species only. We extended classical IPMs to a two-sex framework that allows investigation of population dynamics and quantification of cause-specific mortality rates in nonmonogamous species. We illustrated our approach by simultaneously modeling different types of data from a reintroduced, unhunted brown bear (Ursus arctos) population living in an area with a dense human population. In a population mainly driven by adult survival, we estimated that on average 11% of cubs and 61% of adults died from human-related causes. Although the population is currently not at risk, adult survival and thus population dynamics are driven by anthropogenic mortality. Given the recent increase of human-bear conflicts in the area, removal of individuals for management purposes and through poaching may increase, reversing the positive population growth rate. Our approach can be generalized to other species affected by cause-specific mortality and will be useful to inform conservation decisions for other nonmonogamous species, such as most large carnivores, for which data are scarce and diverse and thus data integration is highly desirable.","[""Animals"",""Conservation of Natural Resources"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Pair Bond"",""Population Dynamics"",""Ursidae""]","[""conflictos humanos – animal en conservación"",""ecología de poblaciones"",""grandes carnívoro"",""hierarchical modeling"",""human-wildlife conflict"",""integrated population model"",""large carnivore"",""modelación jerárquica"",""modelo de dos sexos"",""modelo de población integrado"",""mortality rate"",""population ecology"",""tasa de mortalidad"",""two-sex model"",""Ursus arctos"",""Ursus arctos""]",10.1111/cobi.12736,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982253646,,0

The applicability and relevance of biological and socioeconomic tools to follow EAFM planning guidelines in a data absent area were explored in Kalpitiya, northwest Sri Lanka, where there is a population of spinner dolphins that the local community are especially dependent on through tuna-dolphin association fishing and dolphin-watching tourism. This paper provides background to the design and collection of information leading to the formulation of an EAFM management plan. Scoping and the determination of a fishery management area were completed through stakeholder consultations using a combination of interviewer-administered questionnaires, interviews, meetings, dolphin distribution data and existing management plans. Threats and stakeholder prioritisation were compiled and the final agreed fisheries management area covers a total area of 2445 km2 adjacent to the Kalpitiya peninsula. The completed EAFM plan contains 4 goals, 16 actions and 72 sub-actions agreed by stakeholders.

However, most of our knowledge has come from investigations of single species. The examination of metabolic responses of closely related species with differing distributions around natural elevated CO2 areas may be useful to inform our understanding of their adaptive significance. Furthermore, little is known about the physiological responses of marine invertebrate juveniles to high pCO2, despite the fact they are known to be sensitive to other stressors, often acting as bottlenecks for future species success. We conducted an in situ transplant experiment using juveniles of isopods found living inside and around a high pCO2 vent (Ischia, Italy): the CO2 ‘tolerant’ Dynamene bifida and ‘sensitive’ Cymodoce truncata and Dynamene torelliae. This allowed us to test for any generality of the hypothesis that pCO2 sensitive marine invertebrates may be those that experience trade-offs between energy metabolism and cellular homoeostasis under high pCO2 conditions. Both sensitive species were able to maintain their energy metabolism under high pCO2 conditions, but in C. truncata this may occur at the expense of [carbonic anhydrase], confirming our hypothesis. By comparison, the tolerant D. bifida appeared metabolically well adapted to high pCO2, being able to upregulate ATP production without recourse to anaerobiosis. These isopods are important keystone species; however, given they differ in their metabolic responses to future pCO2, shifts in the structure of the marine ecosystems they inhabit may be expected under future ocean acidification conditions.",,,10.1007/s00227-016-2984-x,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988412545,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00227-016-2984-x.pdf,0

Thus, cities are critical for implementing China's carbon emissions mitigation policies. In this study, we employ an input-output model to calculate consumption-based CO2 emissions for thirteen Chinese cities and find substantial differences between production- and consumption-based accounting in terms of both overall and per capita carbon emissions. Urban consumption not only leads to carbon emissions within a city's own boundaries but also induces emissions in other regions via interregional trade. In megacities such as Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin, approximately 70% of consumption-based emissions are imported from other regions. Annual per capita consumption-based emissions in the three megacities are 14, 12 and 10 tonnes of CO2 per person, respectively. Some medium-sized cities, such as Shenyang, Dalian and Ningbo, exhibit per capita emissions that resemble those in Tianjin. From the perspective of final use, capital formation is the largest contributor to consumption-based emissions at 32–65%. All thirteen cities are categorized by their trading patterns: five are production-based cities in which production-based emissions exceed consumption-based emissions, whereas eight are consumption-based cities, with the opposite emissions pattern. Moreover, production-based cities tend to become consumption-based as they undergo socioeconomic development.","[""City"",""Embodied emissions"",""Input output analysis"",""Input output model"",""Percapita consumption"",""Production and consumption"",""Socio-economic development"",""Trading patterns""]","[""Carbon footprint"",""City"",""Consumption-based accounting"",""Embodied emissions"",""Input-output analysis"",""Production-based emissions""]",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.06.094,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85002489690,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/59842/1/Accepted_manuscript.pdf,0

All rights reserved.Species-transformation provisions allow fishers to convert quota of one species to that of another species at prescribed conversion rates. These provisions, along with other catch-quota balancing mechanisms, are meant to aid fishers in matching available quota to actual catch so that incentives to discard are reduced. In this paper, we use a bioeconomic model to examine how species-transformation provisions affect sustainability and profitability of a multispecies fishery. We base parameterization of the model loosely on management of the Icelandic demersal fishery, which currently employs one of the broadest implementations of species transformations. To represent fisher behaviour in each year, effort is allocated among two or three métiers, such that total profit for that year is maximized. Each métier represents a combination of three species' catchability rates that define which species are targeted by each métier and how independent a species' catch rate is from that of other species. Assumptions regarding the degree to which fishers can target specific species by shifting effort between métiers, as well as how relative profitability among métiers varies, are paramount to understanding more generally how fishing regulations such as species transformations can be expected to change fishing patterns. This constraint depends not only on how strongly associated species catches are within a métier but also on relative species abundance and what alternate métiers are available.",,"[""bioeconomic model"",""catch-quota balancing"",""fisheries management"",""individual fishing quotas"",""joint production"",""métier"",""short-term profit""]",10.1093/icesjms/fsw031,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982972188,https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/73/7/1764/17466898/fsw031.pdf,0

By focusing on how members of Spanish ""Responsible Consumption Cooperatives"" construct and communicate their ethical identities, this study sheds light on the underlying social psychological processes of ethical consumer behaviour from a Social Identity Approach.

This article aims to advance the understanding of corruption in post-war societies by examining how local experiences of corruption relate to ethnic and other divides in Sri Lanka, where a 26-year war was fought largely along ethnic lines. The article builds on 170 interviews carried out in 2009–2013, focusing on how ‘ordinary people’ perceive corruption and ethnic divides after the war. The article argues that ethnic grievances have less to do with local inter-ethnic relations than with relations between the state and minority groups. We find that state–citizen relations in the post-war period to a large extent have been shaped by practices and discourses of corruption. Although corrupt practices—or practices perceived to be corrupt—are prevalent in all parts of the country and affect all groups, they are often interpreted as instances of ethnic discrimination.

In the social and behavioral sciences there have been numerous attempts to map out such differences, especially between countries. Some of these maps are in terms of economic variables, such as GDP. Other maps are based on sociological and psychological variables, such as indices of corruption, institutional and interpersonal trust, and values and norms. To make sense of such differences, reference is made to “culture,” which can represent more or less any aspect of context and of behavior in context. Culture tends to be seen as something big and real, and perhaps mysterious, as illustrated by the frequently mentioned metaphor of three blind men who are touching the trunk, the side of the body, and the tail of one and the same elephant, and report totally different observations, even though they are dealing with the same thing. This metaphor which points to the difficulty of grasping culture is fine for everyday parlance and perhaps for narratives aiming at a deeper understanding of the intricacies of cross-cultural differences. In this chapter, we advocate a pragmatic approach, oriented primarily towards the prediction of differences between countries. In this approach, the emphasis is more on the proportion of variance that can be accounted for by a variable in empirical data than on culture’s specific meaning or even its validity for a targeted construct.",,"[""Culture"",""Explained variance"",""External culture"",""GDP per capita"",""Internal culture""]",10.1007/978-3-319-65091-3_5,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051779812,,0

Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY licenseBackground Improving survival and extending the longevity of life for all populations requires timely, robust evidence on local mortality levels and trends. The Global Burden of Disease 2015 Study (GBD 2015) provides a comprehensive assessment of all-cause and cause-specific mortality for 249 causes in 195 countries and territories from 1980 to 2015. These results informed an in-depth investigation of observed and expected mortality patterns based on sociodemographic measures. Methods We estimated all-cause mortality by age, sex, geography, and year using an improved analytical approach originally developed for GBD 2013 and GBD 2010. Improvements included refinements to the estimation of child and adult mortality and corresponding uncertainty, parameter selection for under-5 mortality synthesis by spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression, and sibling history data processing. We also expanded the database of vital registration, survey, and census data to 14 294 geography–year datapoints. For GBD 2015, eight causes, including Ebola virus disease, were added to the previous GBD cause list for mortality. We used six modelling approaches to assess cause-specific mortality, with the Cause of Death Ensemble Model (CODEm) generating estimates for most causes. We used a series of novel analyses to systematically quantify the drivers of trends in mortality across geographies. First, we assessed observed and expected levels and trends of cause-specific mortality as they relate to the Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a summary indicator derived from measures of income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Second, we examined factors affecting total mortality patterns through a series of counterfactual scenarios, testing the magnitude by which population growth, population age structures, and epidemiological changes contributed to shifts in mortality. Finally, we attributed changes in life expectancy to changes in cause of death. We documented each step of the GBD 2015 estimation processes, as well as data sources, in accordance with Guidelines for Accurate and Transparent Health Estimates Reporting (GATHER). Findings Globally, life expectancy from birth increased from 61·7 years (95% uncertainty interval 61·4–61·9) in 1980 to 71·8 years (71·5–72·2) in 2015. Several countries in sub-Saharan Africa had very large gains in life expectancy from 2005 to 2015, rebounding from an era of exceedingly high loss of life due to HIV/AIDS. At the same time, many geographies saw life expectancy stagnate or decline, particularly for men and in countries with rising mortality from war or interpersonal violence. From 2005 to 2015, male life expectancy in Syria dropped by 11·3 years (3·7–17·4), to 62·6 years (56·5–70·2). Total deaths increased by 4·1% (2·6–5·6) from 2005 to 2015, rising to 55·8 million (54·9 million to 56·6 million) in 2015, but age-standardised death rates fell by 17·0% (15·8–18·1) during this time, underscoring changes in population growth and shifts in global age structures. The result was similar for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with total deaths from these causes increasing by 14·1% (12·6–16·0) to 39·8 million (39·2 million to 40·5 million) in 2015, whereas age-standardised rates decreased by 13·1% (11·9–14·3). Globally, this mortality pattern emerged for several NCDs, including several types of cancer, ischaemic heart disease, cirrhosis, and Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. By contrast, both total deaths and age-standardised death rates due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional conditions significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, gains largely attributable to decreases in mortality rates due to HIV/AIDS (42·1%, 39·1–44·6), malaria (43·1%, 34·7–51·8), neonatal preterm birth complications (29·8%, 24·8–34·9), and maternal disorders (29·1%, 19·3–37·1). Progress was slower for several causes, such as lower respiratory infections and nutritional deficiencies, whereas deaths increased for others, including dengue and drug use disorders. Age-standardised death rates due to injuries significantly declined from 2005 to 2015, yet interpersonal violence and war claimed increasingly more lives in some regions, particularly in the Middle East. In 2015, rotaviral enteritis (rotavirus) was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to diarrhoea (146 000 deaths, 118 000–183 000) and pneumococcal pneumonia was the leading cause of under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infections (393 000 deaths, 228 000–532 000), although pathogen-specific mortality varied by region. Globally, the effects of population growth, ageing, and changes in age-standardised death rates substantially differed by cause. Our analyses on the expected associations between cause-specific mortality and SDI show the regular shifts in cause of death composition and population age structure with rising SDI. Country patterns of premature mortality (measured as years of life lost [YLLs]) and how they differ from the level expected on the basis of SDI alone revealed distinct but highly heterogeneous patterns by region and country or territory. Ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and diabetes were among the leading causes of YLLs in most regions, but in many cases, intraregional results sharply diverged for ratios of observed and expected YLLs based on SDI. Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases caused the most YLLs throughout sub-Saharan Africa, with observed YLLs far exceeding expected YLLs for countries in which malaria or HIV/AIDS remained the leading causes of early death. Interpretation At the global scale, age-specific mortality has steadily improved over the past 35 years; this pattern of general progress continued in the past decade. Progress has been faster in most countries than expected on the basis of development measured by the SDI.

Despite progress in reducing age-standardised death rates, population growth and ageing mean that the number of deaths from most non-communicable causes are increasing in most countries, putting increased demands on health systems.

We calculated the predictive power of each of the 41 variables for the 95 species including a large number of plants, vertebrates and invertebrates. We then calibrated the species distribution models with a set of appropriate variables for each invasive alien species to predict the potential distribution of these species and identify the major regions of origin of the invasive alien species. We found that climate variables were primarily predictors of the distribution of the global invaders studied. In addition, the habitat characteristics were also important predictors following by the socioeconomic variables such as the nearest distance to airports, seaports and human population density. We show that the potential areas at the highest risk of invasions from these species are located in Western Europe, Eastern United States, Central America, the eastern coast of Australia, and some Indonesian islands. We argue that these potential hotspots of invasions should be monitored in priority to prevent new invasions from these species.

Data from the Icelandic Heart Association Úr gögnum Hjartaverndar: Faraldsfrædi kransædasjúkdóma á Íslandi í hálfa öld,"Coronary artery disease has been the leading cause of death and disability in Iceland during the past decades although in recent years, malignancy has taken over that position. A steady improvement in the level of major risk factors has been evident since 1980. This trend explains 72% of the decrease in premature mortality from coronary artery disease during the past three decades. However, an opposing trend in increasing obesity and type 2 diabetes has attenuated this decline in premature deaths. Unchanged risk factor trends will lead to increasing cardiovascular mortality in the years to come. This will result from the above mentioned changes in major risk factors as well as an increased ageing of the Icelandic population. At the same time case fatality after myocardial infarction has declined substantially. This will result in a steadily growing proportion of elderly in the population as well as a high burden of chronic non-communicable diseases among the elderly population. The resulting increase in long term disease and disability will put a major constraint on the health care system and economy alike. According to vital statistics and secular trends the rate of Icelanders in working age for each one reaching retirement age will decrease from the current 5.6 to 2.6 by year 2060.

Here we review knowledge on ambient-temperature (non-geothermal) freshwater springs that achieve sufficient oversaturation for CaCO3 -by physical CO2 degassing and activity of photoautotrophs- to deposit limestone, locally resulting in scenic carbonate structures: Limestone-Precipitating Springs (LPS). The most characteristic organisms in these springs are those that contribute to carbonate precipitation, e.g.: the mosses Palustriella and Eucladium, the crenophilous desmid Oocardium stratum, and cyanobacteria (e.g., Rivularia). These organisms appear to be sensitive to phosphorus pollution. Invertebrate diversity is modest, and highest in pools with an aquatic-terrestrial interface. Internationally, comprehensive legislation for spring protection is still relatively scarce. Where available, it covers all spring types. The situation in Europe is peculiar: the only widespread spring type included in the EU Habitat Directive is LPS, mainly because of landscape aesthetics. To support LPS inventorying and management to meet conservation-legislation requirements we developed a general conceptual model to predict where LPS are more likely to occur. The model is based on the pre-requisites for LPS: an aquifer lithology that enables build-up of high bicarbonate and Ca2 + to sustain CaCO3 oversaturation after spring emergence, combined with intense groundwater percolation especially along structural discontinuities (e.g., fault zones, joints, schistosity), and a proper hydrogeological structure of the discharging area. We validated this model by means of the LPS information system for the Emilia-Romagna Region (northern Italy). The main threats to LPS are water diversion, nutrient enrichment, and lack of awareness by non-specialized persons and administrators. We discuss an emblematic case study to provide management suggestions. The present review is devoted to LPS but the output of intense ecological research in Central Europe during the past decades has clearly shown that effective conservation legislation should be urgently extended to comprise all types of spring habitats.","[""Biocalcification"",""Carbonate precipitation"",""Habitat directives"",""Hydrogeological settings"",""Hydrogeological structures"",""Phosphorus pollution"",""Structural discontinuity"",""Travertines"",""Aquatic Organisms"",""Biodiversity"",""Calcium Carbonate"",""Chemical Precipitation"",""Conservation of Water Resources"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Natural Springs""]","[""Biocalcification"",""EU Habitat Directive"",""Freshwater conservation"",""Limestone-Precipitating Springs (LPS)"",""Spring habitats"",""Spring-Associated Limestones (SAL)"",""Travertines"",""Tufa Springs""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.105,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991674455,,0

Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Stalking among intimate partner is a vicious crime for the police to deal. Several aspects make the police work in intimate partner stalking (IPS) cases demanding for best actions: risk of escalation, reluctance of the victim to report, minimization by the police of impact of stalking, and lack of police skills in non-specialized trained units, increasing risk of secondary victimization. Dedicated types of protective orders (POs) such as warning measures are forms of administrative preventive measures the police can apply in stalking cases. Victims' perspectives on the efficacy and usefulness of these types of POs and the relationship between their use and the way victims report their experience with the police has been rarely investigated. The current study, conducted with 130 Italian victims of IPS who applied for-and obtained -a police warning measure for the stalker, aimed at looking at the efficacy of such measures and at assessing victims' perception of police work, based on victims' perspective and not on the police records on breaching orders. Results indicate that compared with the official police statistics on recidivism rates in stalking cases, the proportion of breaching orders reported by the victims is higher than official data, with over 50% of victims reporting after 1 year they were still stalked. Victims report an overall positive experience with the police and results show a significant relationship between positive experience with the police and perceived efficacy of police work.

All rights reserved.The importance of the atmospheric deposition of biologically essential trace elements, especially iron, is widely recognized, as are the difficulties of accurately quantifying the rates of trace element wet and dry deposition and their fractional solubility. This paper summarizes some of the recent progress in this field, particularly that driven by the GEOTRACES, and other, international research programmes. The utility and limitations of models used to estimate atmospheric deposition flux, for example, from the surface ocean distribution of tracers such as dissolved aluminium, are discussed and a relatively new technique for quantifying atmospheric deposition using the short-lived radionuclide beryllium-7 is highlighted. It is proposed that this field will advance more rapidly by using a multi-tracer approach, and that aerosol deposition models should be ground-truthed against observed aerosol concentration data. It is also important to improve our understanding of the mechanisms and rates that control the fractional solubility of these tracers. Aerosol provenance and chemistry (humidity, acidity and organic ligand characteristics) play important roles in governing tracer solubility. Many of these factors are likely to be influenced by changes in atmospheric composition in the future. Intercalibration exercises for aerosol chemistry and fractional solubility are an essential component of the GEOTRACES programme.

OBJECTIVE To review the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the available data on attitudes and practices. EVIDENCE REVIEW Polling data and published surveys of the public and physicians, official state and country databases, interview studies with physicians, and death certificate studies (the Netherlands and Belgium) were reviewed for the period 1947 to 2016. FINDINGS Currently, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide can be legally practiced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada (Quebec since 2014, nationally as of June 2016). Physician-assisted suicide, excluding euthanasia, is legal in 5 US states (Oregon,Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California) and Switzerland. Public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has plateaued since the 1990s (range, 47%-69%). InWestern Europe, an increasing and strong public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been reported; in Central and Eastern Europe, support is decreasing. In the United States, less than 20%of physicians report having received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, and 5%or less have complied. In Oregon andWashington state, less than 1% of licensed physicians write prescriptions for physician-assisted suicide per year. In the Netherlands and Belgium, about half or more of physicians reported ever having received a request; 60% of Dutch physicians have ever granted such requests. Between 0.3%to 4.6%of all deaths are reported as euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in jurisdictions where they are legal. The frequency of these deaths increased after legalization. More than 70%of cases involved patients with cancer. Typical patients are older, white, and well-educated. Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation. A large portion of patients receiving physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington reported being enrolled in hospice or palliative care, as did patients in Belgium. In no jurisdiction was there evidence that vulnerable patients have been receiving euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide at rates higher than those in the general population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are increasingly being legalized, remain relatively rare, and primarily involve patients with cancer. Existing data do not indicate widespread abuse of these practices.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Attitude of Health Personnel"",""Canada"",""Colombia"",""Europe"",""Euthanasia"",""Humans"",""Middle Aged"",""Neoplasms"",""Practice Guidelines as Topic"",""Public Opinion"",""Suicide, Assisted"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Terminology as Topic"",""United States"",""Withholding Treatment"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1001/jama.2016.8499,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977507826,,0

Methods: Our study quantifies the historical Dutch diet of 75 years ago, based on a cultural history research. We calculate the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and land use (LU) of this diet, using actual life cycle assessment (LCA) data for the 206 most consumed products, and the health score, based on ten nutritional characteristics. In order to meet the current requirements, we optimize this diet for adult males using linear programming. We compare the diet with the present Dutch, Mediterranean, and New Nordic Diet. Results and discussion: An optimized Low Lands Diet has the same healthy nutritional characteristics (Health Score 123) as the Mediterranean Diet (122) and results in a lower environmental impact than the Mediterranean and New Nordic Diet (higher Combined GHGE-LU Score 121 versus 90 and 91). GHGE are 2.60 kg CO2eq per day and LU 2.86 m2 * year per day.

However, uptake rates vary greatly depending on the soil site, and hence estimation of the global soil sink is difficult. Here, we measured the in situ CH4 flux of 15 forests and 14 grasslands on siliceous or calcareous parent materials in summer 2013. To cover the topography of North Tyrol (Austria), sampling sites were distributed over four typical altitudes (500, 1000, 1500, and 2000 m above sea level). Twenty-three of the soils were net sinks for CH4, whereas net CH4 emission occurred at four grassland sites and two sites neither showed net removal nor emission. Flux rates ranged between − 3.2 and 2218.2 μg CH4-C m− 2 h− 1 for grasslands, and between − 3.2 and − 45.0 μg CH4-C m− 2 h− 1 for forests, thus showing that forest soils are significantly more efficient sinks than grassland soils. Soils derived from siliceous parent material were significantly more effective sinks than those derived from calcareous parent material, when only negative flux rates were considered. Multiple regressions indicated that soil dry mass and NH4+-N shaped CH4 flux of grasslands, whereas CH4 flux of forest soils was regulated by soil pH and NO3−-N. Our results provide insights into the CH4 turnover of the so far scarcely studied Central European alpine regions and thus add to the knowledge on this relevant topic.","[""Atmospheric greenhouse"",""Calcareous"",""Forest"",""Grassland"",""Grassland soils"",""Multiple regressions"",""Parent materials"",""Siliceous""]","[""Alpine soil"",""Calcareous"",""CH4 flux"",""Forest"",""Grassland"",""Siliceous""]",10.1016/j.geoderma.2016.06.030,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977636010,,0

Material and methods: Questionnaires regarding contraceptive use and pregnancies were sent to random samples of 19-year-old women in 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 (n = 4732). Results: Current contraceptive use was higher in 2001 (78%) (p < 0.01) and 2011 (69%) (p < 0.05) compared with 1981 (60%) and 1991 (62%). Combined hormonal contraception (CHC) was the most common form of contraception throughout (p < 0.0001). The use of long-acting reversible contraception (LARC = implants, intrauterine contraception) and progestogen-only pills increased over time (p < 0.01). Mental side effects as a reason for CHC cessation increased over time and was the most common reason for cessation of CHC in 2011 (p < 0.001). Contraceptive use was lower in women from low SES areas (p < 0.05) in 2011. The percentage of young women who had been pregnant at ≤19 years of age was lower (p < 0.05) in the assessment from 2001 (7%) than in that in 1991 (13%) and 2011 (12%). The proportion of teenage mothers decreased from 4.4% (1981) to 1.6% (2011) (p < 0.01). More women had been pregnant at ≤19 years of age in low SES areas than in middle and high SES areas (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The lowest pregnancy rate was in the cohort with the highest contraceptive use. Term pregnancies declined over time.

Due to a number of fatalities ascribed to the ingestion of PLTX-contaminated marine organisms, the development of methods for its detection in seafood has been recommended by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Due to its feasibility, the spectrophotometric hemolytic assay is widely used to detect PLTX in different matrices, even though a standardized protocol is still lacking. Thus, on the basis of available assay procedures, a new standardized protocol was set up using purified human erythrocytes exposed to PLTX (working range: 3.9 × 10−10–2.5 × 10−8 M) in a K+-free phosphate buffered saline solution, employing a 5 h incubation at 41 °C. An intra-laboratory characterization demonstrated its sensitivity (limit of detection, LOD = 1.4 × 10−10 M and quantitation, LOQ = 3.4 × 10−10 M), accuracy (bias = −0.8%), repeatability (RSDr = 15% and 6% for intra- and inter-day repeatability, respectively) and specificity. However, the standardized method seems not to be suitable for PLTX quantitation in complex matrices, such as mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) extracts, at least below the limit suggested by EFSA (30 μg PLTXs/Kg shellfish meat). Thus, the hemolytic assay for PLTX quantitation in seafood should be used only after a careful evaluation of the specific matrix effects.","[""Acrylamides"",""Animals"",""Bivalvia"",""Cross Reactions"",""Erythrocytes"",""Hemolysis"",""Humans"",""Limit of Detection"",""Reproducibility of Results""]","[""Hemolytic assay"",""Matrix effect"",""Mytilus galloprovincialis"",""Palytoxin""]",10.1016/j.toxicon.2016.06.013,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976338943,,0

The promise of societal transformation together with scientific breakthroughs contributes to the current popularity of citizen science (CS) in the policy domain. We examined the transformative capacity of citizen science in particular learning through environmental CS as conservation tool. We reviewed the CS and social-learning literature and examined 14 conservation projects across Europe that involved collaborative CS. We also developed a template that can be used to explore learning arrangements (i.e., learning events and materials) in CS projects and to explain how the desired outcomes can be achieved through CS learning. We found that recent studies aiming to define CS for analytical purposes often fail to improve the conceptual clarity of CS; CS programs may have transformative potential, especially for the development of individual skills, but such transformation is not necessarily occurring at the organizational and institutional levels; empirical evidence on simple learning outcomes, but the assertion of transformative effects of CS learning is often based on assumptions rather than empirical observation; and it is unanimous that learning in CS is considered important, but in practice it often goes unreported or unevaluated. In conclusion, we point to the need for reliable and transparent measurement of transformative effects for democratization of knowledge production.","[""Community Participation"",""Conservation of Natural Resources"",""Data Collection"",""Europe"",""Humans"",""Learning"",""Research"",""Volunteers""]","[""aprendizaje transformador"",""biodiversidad"",""biodiversity"",""collaborative assessment"",""interacciones"",""participación"",""participation"",""política ciencia-sociedad"",""science-society-policy interactions"",""transformative learning"",""valoración colaborativa""]",10.1111/cobi.12762,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027949288,https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/cobi.12762,0

In this paper, we study whether the redevelopment of 36 industrial heritage sites in The Netherlands caused positive external effects by investigating the development of house prices in nearby residential areas. We use a difference-in-difference design by comparing quality-adjusted house prices in a predefined target and control area before the start, between the start and the completion and after the completion of the redevelopment. We also model the spatial and temporal dimensions of these external effects. We find that these dimensions matter substantially. We find that negative externalities on house prices before the start completely disappear after the start of the redevelopment of industrial heritage sites.

Reporting is a means through which companies try to demonstrate their commitment to CSR by offering clear and precise information, similar to more traditional reporting documents. In this study we relied on the Global reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines in order to assess the commitment to sustainability of a sample of major agribusiness companies. The level of comprehensive reporting of the social responsibility reports of the selected companies was assessed using a content analysis framework. The results of the study indicate a low level of comprehensive CSR reporting, with only a few companies reaching a high value of comprehensiveness.

Design Population-based prospective cohort study. Participants A total of 4966 individuals aged 67 to 96 years (43.2% were male) from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS). Methods Retinopathy was evaluated from digital fundus images (2002-2006) using the modified Airlie House adaptation of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol. Mortality was assessed through September 2013 (cause of death assigned through 2009). Cox proportional hazards regression models, with age as the time scale, estimated the association between retinopathy and death while controlling for risk factors and the presence of concomitant health conditions. Main Outcome Measures Mortality from all causes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Results Among the 4966 participants, 503 (10.1%) had diabetes and 614 (12.4%) had retinopathy at baseline. A subset of these (136 [2.7%]) had both diabetes and retinopathy. After a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 1763 persons died, 276 (45.0%) with retinopathy and 1487 (34.2%) without retinopathy, of whom 76 and 162 persons, respectively, also had diabetes. There were 366 deaths from CVD through 2009, 72 (11.7%) in persons with retinopathy and 294 (6.8%) in those without retinopathy. In multivariable analyses, retinopathy was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.43; P < 0.01) and CVD-related mortality (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.20-2.06; P < 0.01). Findings were more striking in men: all-cause HR, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.11-1.60) and CVD HR, 1.81 (95% CI, 1.25-2.63).

We evaluated the response of species richness and diversity of aquatic macrophyte (hydrophyte, instream aquatic plant) growth forms and strategies (Grime’s CSR strategies; C competitive, S stress tolerant, R ruderal) in 10 small- and 10 large-scale river restoration projects in nine European countries. Restoration had no effect on total richness and diversity but significant effects if specific growth forms and plant strategies were considered. Results indicated that restoration caused an increase in the richness and diversity of submerged and a decrease in the proportion of competitive species. Responses were especially pronounced in relatively small widening projects in gravel-bed mountain rivers but not in relatively large restoration projects in sand-bed lowland rivers. Moreover, flow restoration increased the richness and diversity of floating-leaved species. In rivers with a high proportion of wetlands and waterbodies in the catchment, restoration increased the abundance of competitive plants. These results highlight that river and catchment properties need to be considered when evaluating river restoration projects. We suggest hydrophyte growth forms and plant strategies as suitable response variables to assess the effect of river restoration projects.",,"[""Aquatic macrophytes"",""CSR"",""Ecological indicator"",""Grime"",""Life form"",""Restoration success""]",10.1007/s10750-015-2605-6,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959454784,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10750-015-2605-6.pdf,0

Thus, we can learn much about the responses of modern plants to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) by studying their performance under a range of carbon and water availabilities, including very low CO2 as in past glacial periods. We hypothesized that, especially in shallow soils, the positive effects of high CO2 and the negative effects of low CO2 on growth response to drought are moderated by plant size-driven feedbacks through transpiration and soil water depletion. We grew two temperate annual C3 species, Avena sativa and Chenopodium album, in glacial (180 ppm), modern (400 ppm) and future (700 ppm) CO2 levels and five soil water regimes in climate chambers. In both species, low CO2 resulted in a much lower relative growth rate, biomass and total leaf area than at ambient CO2 with higher water availability, but this difference disappeared steadily towards severe drought conditions. Elevated CO2 increased relative growth rate, plant biomass and total leaf area of both species slightly compared with ambient CO2. These results were especially pronounced under drought. Our results support the hypothesis that, in annuals, plant size modulates the negative drought effect at low CO2. However, plant size-mediated effects of high CO2 on growth response to drought were inconclusive. Further experiments should reveal the interactive effects of CO2 and water regimes in environments closer to a field setting, both in shallow and in deep soils with unconstrained rooting, as well as in mixed communities.",,"[""Biomass accumulation"",""CO2 concentration"",""Drought"",""Relative growth rate"",""Water use efficiency""]",10.1007/s11284-015-1330-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959167414,,0

While atmospheric modeling traces the link from emissions to deposition of Hg onto environmental surfaces, large uncertainties arise from our incomplete understanding of atmospheric processes (oxidation pathways, deposition, and re-emission). Atmospheric Hg reactivity is exacerbated in high latitudes and there is still much to be learned from polar regions in terms of atmospheric processes. This paper provides a synthesis of the atmospheric Hg monitoring data available in recent years (2011-2015) in the Arctic and in Antarctica along with a comparison of these observations with numerical simulations using four cutting-edge global models. The cycle of atmospheric Hg in the Arctic and in Antarctica presents both similarities and differences. Coastal sites in the two regions are both influenced by springtime atmospheric Hg depletion events and by summertime snowpack re-emission and oceanic evasion of Hg. The cycle of atmospheric Hg differs between the two regions primarily because of their different geography. While Arctic sites are significantly influenced by northern hemispheric Hg emissions especially in winter, coastal Antarctic sites are significantly influenced by the reactivity observed on the East Antarctic ice sheet due to katabatic winds. Based on the comparison of multi-model simulations with observations, this paper discusses whether the processes that affect atmospheric Hg seasonality and interannual variability are appropriately represented in the models and identifies research gaps in our understanding of the atmospheric Hg cycling in high latitudes.",,,10.5194/acp-16-10735-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84984871103,https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/16/10735/2016/acp-16-10735-2016.pdf,0

European Journal of Heart Failure © 2016 European Society of CardiologyAims: To describe the outcomes of pregnancy in women with pulmonary hypertension. Methods and results: In 2007 the European Registry on Pregnancy and Heart Disease was initiated by the European Society of Cardiology. Consecutive patients with all forms of cardiovascular disease, presenting with pregnancy, were enrolled with the aim of investigating the pregnancy outcomes. This subgroup of the cohort included 151 women with pulmonary hypertension (PH) either diagnosed by right heart catheterization or diagnosed as possible PH by echocardiographic signs, with 26% having pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), in three subgroups: idiopathic (iPAH), associated with congenital heart disease (CHD-PAH), or associated with other disease (oPAH), and 74% having PH caused by left heart disease (LHD-PH, n = 112). Maternal mean age was 29.2 ± 5.6 years and 37% were nulliparous. Right ventricular systolic pressure was <50 mmHg in 59.6% of patients, 50–70 mmHg in 28.5% and >70 mmHg in 11.9%. In more than 75% of patients, the diagnosis of PH had been made before pregnancy. Maternal death up to 1 week after delivery occurred in five patients (3.3%), with another two out of 78 patients who presented for follow-up (2.6%), dying within 6 months after delivery. The highest mortality was found in iPAH (3/7, 43%). During pregnancy, heart failure occurred in 27%. Caesarean section was performed in 63.4% (23.9% as emergency). Therapeutic abortion was performed in 4.0%. Complications included miscarriage (5.6%), fetal mortality (2%), premature delivery (21.7%), low birth weight (19.0%), and neonatal mortality (0.7%). Conclusion: Mortality in this group of patients with various forms of PH was lower than previously reported as specialized care during pregnancy and delivery was available. However, maternal and fetal mortality remains prohibitively high in women with iPAH, although this conclusion is restricted by limited numbers.

A model study,"© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.The climate of the Holocene, the current interglacial covering the past 11,700 years, has been relatively stable compared to previous periods. Nevertheless, repeating occurrence of rapid natural climate changes that challenged human society are seen in proxy reconstructions. Ocean sediment cores for example display prominent peaks of enhanced ice rafted debris (IRD) during the Holocene with a multi-decadal to millennial scale periodicity. Different mechanisms were proposed that caused these enhanced IRD events, for example variations in the incoming total solar irradiance (TSI), volcanic eruptions and the combination of internal climate variability and external forcings. We investigate the probable mechanisms causing the occurrence of IRD-events over the past 6000 years using a fully coupled climate - ice-sheet - iceberg model (iLOVECLIM). We performed 19 experiments that differ in the applied forcings (TSI, volcanic) and the initial atmospheric conditions. To explore internal ice sheet variability one further experiment was done with fixed climate conditions. All the model runs displayed prominent peaks of enhanced iceberg melt flux (IMF), independent of the chosen experimental set-up. The spectral analysis of the experiments with the ice-sheet - climate model coupled displays significant peaks at 2000, 1000 years in all the experiments and at 500 years in most runs. The experiment with fixed climate conditions displays one significant peak of about 1500 years related to internal ice sheet variability. This frequency is modulated to 2000 and 1000 years in all the experiments with a coupled climate - ice sheet due to interactions between the climate components. We further investigate the impact of minimum TSI events on the timing and occurrence of enhanced IMF. In the experimental set-up that was forced with idealized sinusoidal TSI variations (±4 Wm-2), we find a significant occurrence of an increased iceberg melt flux about 60 years after the minimum TSI value. Yet, we also see a significant time lag of 80 years between reconstructed TSI minima and the simulated enhanced iceberg melt flux in some of the experiments without TSI forcing. The fact that also model runs that are not forced with TSI variations display an 80 year time lag indicates that the relationship between TSI and IMF is due to internal dynamics of the coupled system. From our experiments we conclude that internal ice sheet variability seems to be the source of the multi-century and millennial-scale iceberg events during the Holocene.","[""Different mechanisms"",""Greenland Ice Sheet"",""Holocenes"",""Icebergs"",""Initial atmospheric conditions"",""Internal climate variability"",""Proxy reconstruction"",""Total solar irradiance""]","[""Bond events"",""Climate modeling"",""Greenland ice sheet"",""Holocene"",""Icebergs""]",10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.01.026,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960903666,http://manuscript.elsevier.com/S0277379116300282/pdf/S0277379116300282.pdf,0

Miscanthus bioenergy and bioproduct chains were investigated by trialing 15 diverse germplasm types in a range of climatic and soil environments across central Europe,Ukraine,Russia,and China. The abiotic stress tolerances of a wider panel of 100 germplasm types to drought,salinity,and low temperatures were measured in the laboratory and a field trial in Belgium. Asmall selection of germplasmtypes was evaluated for performance in grasslands on marginal sites in Germany and the UK. The growth traits underlying biomass yield and quality were measured to improve regional estimates of feedstock availability. Several potential high-value bioproducts were identified. The combined results provide recommendations to policymakers,growers and industry. The major technical advances in miscanthus production achieved by OPTIMISC include: (1) demonstration that novel hybrids can out-yield the standard commercially grown genotype Miscanthus x giganteus; (2) characterization of the interactions of physiological growth responses with environmental variation within andbetween sites; (3) quantification of biomass-quality-relevant traits; (4) abiotic stress tolerances of miscanthus genotypes; (5) selections suitable for production on marginal land; (6) field establishment methods for seeds using plugs; (7) evaluation of harvesting methods; and (8) quantification of energy used in densification (pellet) technologies with a range of hybrids with differences in stem wall properties. End-user needs were addressed by demonstrating the potential of optimizing miscanthus biomass composition for the production of ethanol and biogas as well as for combustion. The costs and life-cycle assessment of seven miscanthus-based value chains,including small- and large-scale heat and power,ethanol,biogas,and insulation material production,revealed GHG-emission- and fossil-energy-saving potentials of up to 30.6 t CO2eq C ha−1 y−1 and 429 GJ ha−1 y−1 ,respectively. Transport distance was identified as an important cost factor. Negative carbon mitigation costs of –78€−1 CO2eq C were recorded for local biomass use.

This is a key process in the marine ecosystem, which links the food webs of the sea-floor and the overlying water-column, and is potentially affected by a range of interacting environmental and sedimentary factors. Here, we use General Additive Models (GAM) to statistically disentangle some of the factors controlling the seasonal and spatial variability in nutrients and oxygen fluxes in a field dataset collected in the North Sea off the northeast coast of Scotland. We show that sediment grain size, turbidity due to sediment re-suspension, temperature, and sediment chlorophyll content were the key factors affecting oxygen, ammonia, and silicate fluxes. However, phosphate fluxes were only related to suspended sediment concentrations, whilst nitrate fluxes showed no clear relationship to any of the expected drivers of change, probably due to the effects of denitrification.

Critical information can only be provided by patients themselves, but interviewing patients is time-consuming. Alternatively, patient information could be obtained with a questionnaire. Objective In this study the agreement between patient information on medication use and drug-related problems in older patients obtained with a questionnaire was compared with information obtained during an interview. Setting General practice in The Netherlands. Method A questionnaire was developed to obtain information on actual medication use and drug-related problems. Two patient groups ≥65 years were selected based on general practitioner electronic medical records in nine practices; I. polypharmacy and II. ≥1 predefined general geriatric problems. Eligible patients were asked to complete the questionnaire and were interviewed afterwards. Main outcome measure Agreement on information on medication use and drug-related problems collected with the questionnaire and interview was calculated. Results Ninety-seven patients participated. Of all medications used, 87.6 % (95 % CI 84.7–90.5) was reported identically in the questionnaire and interview. Agreement for the complete medication list was found for 45.4 % (95 % CI 35.8–55.3) of the patients. On drug-related problem level, agreement between questionnaire and interview was 75 %. Agreement tended to be lower in vulnerable patients characterized by ≥4 chronic diseases, ≥10 medications used and low health literacy.

Despite the South Georgia rat eradication programme being the geographically largest and most ambitious eradication initiative to date, its success is facilitated by the potential that rat populations are effectively isolated by glacial barriers. This allows for localized eradication effort at manageable scales, leading to sequential eradication of individual populations with minimal risk of incursion from neighbouring areas. Here, we use the levels of population genetic divergence estimated from 299 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci and DNA sequence variation across 993 base pairs of the mitochondrial DNA cytochrome B locus to examine whether rat populations from nine glacially isolated areas on South Georgia are genetically distinct and so can be treated as independent eradication units. Bayesian clustering of individuals based on SNP similarity identified seven different genetic groups, which were confirmed using analyses based on pairwise genetic distance estimates and ordination of individuals using principal coordinate analysis. From a management perspective, these seven groups represent individual targets in baiting operations. Two mtDNA haplotypes were resolved across South Georgia, with a distinct geographical separation between the north-western and south-eastern populations. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) was used to identify that this divergence was a consequence of two separate historical colonization events. Synthesis and applications. We illustrate that molecular markers are a valuable tool in species management and pest eradication given that the spatial distribution of genetic diversity can: (i) identify demographically and genetically independent populations on which local eradication effort can be focussed, (ii) distinguish between incomplete eradication and immigration in situations where individuals remain after eradication has been attempted and (iii) identify the source of migrants when dispersal occurs over large spatial scales.

Unintentional injury is a major cause of disability and death in children aged 1–4 years; those living in poverty are at greatest risk. CCs are pivotal in English public health strategies to improve outcomes and reduce inequalities for disadvantaged children through health promotion and family support. This study is part of the National Institute for Health Research funded ‘Keeping Children Safe at home’ programme, which aims to develop a better understanding of how to prevent unintentional injuries in pre-school children. Thirty-three interviews with CC staff from 16 CCs across four study sites, Nottingham, Norwich, Newcastle and Bristol, explored practitioners’ experience of factors that impact on their implementation of health promotion and injury prevention interventions. Using Framework Analysis, managed by NVivo, key facilitators and barriers were identified across all levels of CCs’ operation. Facilitators included knowledge of policies and strategies in injury prevention, partnership working and effective parent engagement. Barriers included paucity of national and local injury data, difficulties reaching disengaged families and funding constraints. The challenge is to learn from those who work in CCs the best ways to harness facilitators and to address barriers to child injury prevention activities, and to provide support, including practical advice, for further development of their essential work in injury prevention.",,"[""barriers and facilitators"",""children’s centres"",""injury prevention"",""parents"",""young children""]",10.1080/14635240.2015.1065710,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941370213,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/56412/1/Barriers_and_facilitators_to_delivering_injury_prevention_interventions_in_English_childrens_centres_16_December_2014.pdf,0

Background: Some scholars argue that the decision-making capacities of children largely depend on the attitudes of healthcare professionals rather than on the children's own competences. Healthcare professionals' perspectives on children's participation in hospital care remain largely unexplored. Design: Qualitative descriptive design. Methods: Healthcare professionals (n = 32) from 10 paediatric wards in the Netherlands participated in semi-structured interviews. Shier's Pathways to Participation model (2001) was used to guide the interviews. Results: Participation is not a term that is frequently used by professionals; however, they feel familiar with the ideas underlying the term, and it is perceived as being at the core of their work. Professionals believe that high levels of participation are possible in basic care for children. Participation in medical decision-making is considered to be more complex and subject to a number of reservations and restrictions. The participants expressed a strong need to enhance child participation in service evaluation and to increase the respect for and understanding of the rights of children to participate outside of the paediatric unit, including in the surgery and emergency departments. Conclusion: Children do not currently participate in the assessment of hospital services. Creative methods that support the role of children in evaluating and improving the quality of paediatric hospital care and services should be developed. Hospital-wide policies could help to promote understanding of child participation among all professionals caring for children in hospitals. Relevance to clinical practice: Based on international agreements that the Netherlands has ratified, professionals have the duty to facilitate child participation in hospital care. Concrete opportunities and ideas on how to accomplish this goal in practice are provided, and areas for improvement are identified.","[""Adolescent"",""Age Factors"",""Attitude of Health Personnel"",""Child"",""Decision Making"",""Female"",""Hospitals, Pediatric"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Netherlands"",""Patient Participation"",""Qualitative Research"",""Young Adult""]","[""Child participation"",""Child-centred care"",""Health professionals' perspectives"",""Paediatrics"",""Shared decision-making""]",10.1111/jocn.13152,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961181769,,0

To ensure the long-term progress that restoration programmes are expected to deliver, they must be designed, implemented and maintained in partnership with local stakeholders. Each programme should have clear goals, followed up by measurable ecological and/or socio-economic objectives, to facilitate their evaluation in the long run. In this research, we examine if a large-scale rangeland restoration programme in Iceland had contributed to the expected attitudinal and behavioural changes among the participating sheep farmers, as described in the initial objectives of the programme. A survey, based on a questionnaire on sheep farmers' attitude and behaviour related to rangeland restoration and land management practices, was used to gauge the perception of participating farmers, in comparison with non-participating farmers. Our results show that participating farmers are more aware of the potential of rangeland restoration and are more motivated to engage in further collaboration, when compared with non-participating farmers. Nevertheless, our results indicate that, despite extensive areas of degraded land already successfully treated within the restoration programme, the programme has not facilitated other anticipated attitudinal and behavioural changes among its participants as expected. Furthermore, it seems that the direct incentives provided by the programme are pushing participating farmers towards favouring agronomic instead of ecological approaches in their restoration activities, when compared with the non-participating farmers. Our results also point to several organizational errors embedded in the programme management that might be halting its further progress.

A critical question still unanswered is if selection pressures within STPs, caused by residual antibiotics or other co-selective agents, are sufficient to specifically promote resistance. To address this, we employed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of samples from different steps of the treatment process in three Swedish STPs. In parallel, concentrations of selected antibiotics, biocides and metals were analyzed. We found that concentrations of tetracycline and ciprofloxacin in the influent were above predicted concentrations for resistance selection, however, there was no consistent enrichment of resistance genes to any particular class of antibiotics in the STPs, neither for biocide and metal resistance genes. The most substantial change of the bacterial communities compared to human feces occurred already in the sewage pipes, manifested by a strong shift from obligate to facultative anaerobes. Through the treatment process, resistance genes against antibiotics, biocides and metals were not reduced to the same extent as fecal bacteria. The OXA-48 gene was consistently enriched in surplus and digested sludge. We find this worrying as OXA-48, still rare in Swedish clinical isolates, provides resistance to carbapenems, one of our most critically important classes of antibiotics. Taken together, metagenomics analyses did not provide clear support for specific antibiotic resistance selection. However, stronger selective forces affecting gross taxonomic composition, and with that resistance gene abundances, limit interpretability. Comprehensive analyses of resistant/non-resistant strains within relevant species are therefore warranted.","[""Antibiotic resistance"",""Antibiotic resistance genes"",""Antibiotic-resistant bacteria"",""Comprehensive analysis"",""Facultative anaerobes"",""Fecal bacteria"",""Microbial ecology"",""Taxonomic composition"",""Anti-Bacterial Agents"",""Bacteria"",""DNA Transposable Elements"",""Drug Resistance, Bacterial"",""Drug Resistance, Microbial"",""Metagenomics"",""Metals"",""RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"",""Selection, Genetic"",""Sewage"",""Sweden"",""Waste Disposal, Fluid"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Antibiotic resistance genes"",""Co-selection"",""Fecal bacteria"",""Microbial ecology"",""Risk assessment"",""Wastewater treatment""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.06.228,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989282570,,0

Egg production was more sensitive than mortality to TPBP (EC50 3.2 nmol l−1), while DCOIT and medetomidine inhibited egg production at roughly the same concentrations (72 and 186 nmol l−1 respectively). Furthermore, TPBP seems to affect egg hatching directly which was not the case for DCOIT and medetomidine. DCOIT and medetomidine might pose an environmental risk as they have been reported to occur in different exposure scenarios or analytical surveys at concentrations only 2–3 times lower than the respective EC10.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Amphetamine dependence, besides its substantial economical consequence, is a serious cause of mortality and morbidity. By investigations of the neurochemical correlates through which addictive drugs, such as amphetamine, activate the mesoaccumbal dopamine system unique targets for treatment of drug addiction can be identified. This reward link consists of a dopamine projection from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) suggesting that these brain areas are important for reward. The physiological function of gut-brain peptides has expanded beyond food intake modulation and involves regulation of drug reinforcement. A novel candidate for reward regulation is the anorexigenic peptide neuromedin U (NMU). We therefore investigated the effects of intracerebroventricular (icv) administration of NMU on amphetamine's well-documented effects on the mesoaccumbal dopamine system, i.e. locomotor stimulation and accumbal dopamine release in mice. In addition, the effect of accumbal NMU administration on locomotor activity was examined. The effect of NMU, icv or intra-NAc, on the expression of conditioned place preference (CPP) was elucidated. Firstly, we showed that icv administration of NMU attenuate the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation, accumbal dopamine release and expression of CPP in mice. Secondly, we found that a lower dose of NMU (icv) reduce the amphetamine-induced locomotor stimulation in mice. Thirdly, we demonstrated that NMU administration into the NAc block the ability of amphetamine to cause a locomotor stimulation in mice. However, accumbal NMU administration did not attenuate the amphetamine-induced expression of CPP in mice. Our novel data suggest that central NMU signalling is involved in development of amphetamine dependence.","[""Amphetamine"",""Animals"",""Conditioning (Psychology)"",""Dopamine"",""Drug-Seeking Behavior"",""Locomotion"",""Male"",""Mice"",""Neuropeptides"",""Nucleus Accumbens"",""Reward"",""Spatial Behavior""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0154477,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969580001,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0154477&type=printable,0

At Mauna Loa, Hawaii, the annual CO2 concentration increased by a record 3.1 ppm, exceeding 400 ppm for the first time on record. The 2015 global CO2 average neared this threshold, at 399.4 ppm. Additionally, one of the strongest El Niño events since at least 1950 developed in spring 2015 and continued to evolve through the year. The phenomenon was far reaching, impacting many regions across the globe and affecting most aspects of the climate system. Owing to the combination of El Niño and a long-term upward trend, Earth observed record warmth for the second consecutive year, with the 2015 annual global surface temperature surpassing the previous record by more than 0.1°C and exceeding the average for the mid- to late 19th century—commonly considered representative of preindustrial conditions—by more than 1°C for the first time. Above Earth’s surface, lower troposphere temperatures were near-record high. Across land surfaces, record to near-record warmth was reported across every inhabited continent. Twelve countries, including Russia and China, reported record high annual temperatures. In June, one of the most severe heat waves since 1980 affected Karachi, Pakistan, claiming over 1000 lives. On 27 October, Vredendal, South Africa, reached 48.4°C, a new global high temperature record for this month. In the Arctic, the 2015 land surface temperature was 1.2°C above the 1981–2010 average, tying 2007 and 2011 for the highest annual temperature and representing a 2.8°C increase since the record began in 1900. Increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. On 25 February 2015, the lowest maximum sea ice extent in the 37-year satellite record was observed, 7% below the 1981–2010 average. Mean sea surface temperatures across the Arctic Ocean during August in ice-free regions, representative of Arctic Ocean summer anomalies, ranged from ~0°C to 8°C above average. As a consequence of sea ice retreat and warming oceans, vast walrus herds in the Pacific Arctic are hauling out on land rather than on sea ice, raising concern about the energetics of females and young animals. Increasing temperatures in the Barents Sea are linked to a community-wide shift in fish populations: boreal communities are now farther north, and long-standing Arctic species have been almost pushed out of the area. Above average sea surface temperatures are not confined to the Arctic. Sea surface temperature for 2015 was record high at the global scale; however, the North Atlantic southeast of Greenland remained colder than average and colder than 2014. Global annual ocean heat content and mean sea level also reached new record highs. The Greenland Ice Sheet, with the capacity to contribute ~7 m to sea level rise, experienced melting over more than 50% of its surface for the first time since the record melt of 2012. Other aspects of the cryosphere were remarkable. Alpine glacier retreat continued, and preliminary data indicate that 2015 is the 36th consecutive year of negative annual mass balance. Across the Northern Hemisphere, late-spring snow cover extent continued its trend of decline, with June the second lowest in the 49-year satellite record. Below the surface, record high temperatures at 20-m depth were measured at all permafrost observatories on the North Slope of Alaska, increasing by up to 0.66°C decade–1 since 2000. In the Antarctic, surface pressure and temperatures were lower than the 1981–2010 average for most of the year, consistent with the primarily positive southern annular mode, which saw a record high index value of +4.92 in February. Antarctic sea ice extent and area had large intra-annual variability, with a shift from record high levels in May to record low levels in August. Springtime ozone depletion resulted in one of the largest and most persistent Antarctic ozone holes observed since the 1990s. Closer to the equator, 101 named tropical storms were observed in 2015, well above the 1981–2010 average of 82. The eastern/central Pacific had 26 named storms, the most since 1992. The western north Pacific and north and south Indian Ocean basins also saw high activity. Globally, eight tropical cyclones reached the Saffir–Simpson Category 5 intensity level. Overlaying a general increase in the hydrologic cycle, the strong El Niño enhanced precipitation variability around the world. An above-normal rainy season led to major floods in Paraguay, Bolivia, and southern Brazil. In May, the United States recorded its all-time wettest month in its 121-year national record. Denmark and Norway reported their second and third wettest year on record, respectively, but globally soil moisture was below average, terrestrial groundwater storage was the lowest in the 14-year record, and areas in “severe” drought rose from 8% in 2014 to 14% in 2015. Drought conditions prevailed across many Caribbean island nations, Colombia, Venezuela, and northeast Brazil for most of the year. Several South Pacific countries also experienced drought. Lack of rainfall across Ethiopia led to its worst drought in decades and affected millions of people, while prolonged drought in South Africa severely affected agricultural production. Indian summer monsoon rainfall was just 86% of average. Extremely dry conditions in Indonesia resulted in intense and widespread fires during August–November that produced abundant carbonaceous aerosols, carbon monoxide, and ozone. Overall, emissions from tropical Asian biomass burning in 2015 were almost three times the 2001–14 average.","[""Agricultural productions"",""Global surface temperature"",""Indian summer monsoon rainfall"",""Intra-annual variability"",""Land surface temperature"",""Pre-industrial conditions"",""Precipitation variability"",""Sea surface temperature (SST)""]",,10.1175/2016BAMSStateoftheClimate.1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84986201515,https://journals.ametsoc.org/bams/article-pdf/97/8/Si/3746652/2016bamsstateoftheclimate_1.pdf,0

The results highlight that the sea level in Roman times, deduced from the submersion measurement of archaeological markers, did not exceed 1.2 m ± 0.30 m, except for Seiano whose submerged remains and surrounding area were heavily damaged by extreme events following the 79 CE Vesuvius eruption. The comparison of these results with the eustatic sea-level curve in Roman times together with the submersion of the tectonically stable site on the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy (Torre Astura, with a well-preserved Roman fishpond) demonstrate that the Sorrento Peninsula has been tectonically stable over the last two millennia. This behaviour started many thousands of years ago, not later than the last interglacial, while the nearby plain of Pompeii and probably the bottom of the adjacent Gulf of Naples have been subsiding at rates of 1 or more mm per year. In the same time span, two of the investigated coastal sectors (Capo di Sorrento and Punta Campanella) have not suffered any significant changes because their sea cliffs are cut in hard limestone. The tufa sea cliff of the Sorrento plain on the other hand, has been retreating by several metres.

This gap in labor economics research is all the more perplexing since gender equality, particularly in education and employment, significantly contributes to economic growth. The research strategy of this paper is within a relatively new tradition in labor market research, initiated by Besamusca et al. (2015), which does not exclude the ""religious factor"" and what the authors call ""gender ideology"". Our analysis of the ""gender ideology"" of Islamism and gender values is based on an empirical analysis of World Values Survey data. In recent economic theory, Carvalho (2013) maintained that Muslim veiling is a strategy for integration, enabling women to take up outside economic opportunities while preserving their reputation within the community. The empirical data clearly support a pessimistic view. We show that Muslim Feminism, which according to our analysis implies the rejection of Islamism and the veil, and the democracy movement in the Muslim world, are closely interrelated.

However, to determine the actual influence of these factors on the distribution of human populations, it is necessary to quantify and compare their values for different sites and environmental conditions. Thus, a standard method to measure competition intensity and resource availability in different assemblages is required. The primary consumer biomass to secondary consumer biomass ratio is commonly used to describe trophic conditions within a mammal community. However, this ratio oversimplifies existing conditions because the feeding habits and limitations of the secondary consumers are not taken into account. We present different indices to measure the intensity of competition between secondary consumers in faunal assemblages using a standard approach and a mathematical model based on the Leslie Matrices. In this way, competition intensity between different faunal assemblages may be compared. The mathematical model provides sustainable densities for each secondary consumer species in an assemblage by taking into account the available prey and existing competitors, and expected densities are estimated from allometric equations. We developed six indices based on the available biomass for secondary consumers and their sustainable biomass, and we applied these indices to different recent and Pleistocene faunal assemblages to identify their potential. The results indicate that different indices provide different information that is useful in the analysis of competition intensity between secondary consumers. The primary and secondary consumer biomass ratio (prey–predator ratio) indices provide information on the proportions of these elements with a given system, and the correlation coefficient between these factors may indicate the biome type of the area. To measure the degree of competition between consumers, it appears more appropriate to use the indices based on the degree of dissatisfaction (estimates-expected density ratio) between those consumers' requirements. The paleocommunities reveal values inside the range observed in recent faunal assemblages for both indices. Moreover, the three Pleistocene assemblages analyzed show a pattern of variation between prey–predator ratios that has been observed in other Pleistocene Mediterranean faunal assemblages.",,"[""Competition indices"",""Intraguild competition"",""Macromammals"",""Primary and secondary consumer guild""]",10.1016/j.quaint.2015.11.087,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961282074,,0

Methodology: From June 2012 to February 2013, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 parents of children aged from 3 to 18 years. The young patients fulfilled all criteria to be eligible for SPPHC. 13 of the families experienced SPPHC. 7 families did not utilise the specialised care, mostly because the palliative situation occurred before the implementation of specialised care. Data were analysed using content analysis (Mayring). Therefore, key aspects of paediatric palliative home care were summarised in main categories. The evaluation of parent's satisfaction with palliative home care was performed by an evaluation scheme developed for the main categories (very good - good - bad- very bad) and operated for every case. Results: 6 dimensions of paediatric palliative home care were identified: (i) benefit of care, (ii) continuity of care, (iii) perception of care providers as a team, (iv) dealing with the issues death and dying/hospice and palliative, (v) care provider's communication/cooperation with parents, and (vi) parent's Information. As all parents clearly indicated a rating on the first 3 categories, these categories were selected for the evaluation of parent's satisfaction with the received home care. The evaluation revealed that parents experienced in SPPHC looked upon these 3 main categories more favourably than parents without the experience of SPPHC. As room for improvement, the respondents requested the extension of physician's presence and communication with the families as well as with each other, efforts to better meet the needs of psycho-social support of the families and to optimise follow up-care. Conclusion: The implementation of SAPPV was rated positively by the concerned families. In addition, options for improvement could be identified.","[""Adolescent"",""Attitude to Death"",""Attitude to Health"",""Child"",""Child, Preschool"",""Continuity of Patient Care"",""Female"",""Germany"",""Home Care Services"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Palliative Care"",""Parents"",""Patient Satisfaction"",""Quality Assurance, Health Care""]","[""children"",""content analysis"",""life-limiting conditions"",""qualitative evaluation"",""specialised palliative home care""]",10.1055/s-0034-1390451,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973440969,,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Public Health Association. All rights reserved.Background: The European population is aging. The main drivers of public spending on health care for people of 65 years and older are hospital admission and admission to long-term care facilities. High quality community care can be a cost-effective and quality solution to respond to the impact of ageing populations on health-care systems. It is unclear how well countries are equipped to provide affordable and quality community care. The aim of this article is to describe and compare community care delivery with care-dependent older people in Europe. Methods: This study is conducted within the European Union-financed IBenC project [Identifying best practices for care-dependent elderly by Benchmarking Costs and outcomes of community care (FP7)] in which six European countries are involved. To compare the community care delivery with care-dependent older people in these countries, we performed a systematic comparison of macro indicators using metadata complemented with data from multinational surveys. Results: Data on the following dimensions are described and compared: population of the country, governmental expenditures on health, sources of community health services funding, governmental vision and regulation on community care, community care organisations and care professionals, eligibility criteria for and equity in receiving care and the involvement of informal care. Conclusion: Because of the variations in the European community care contexts, the growing demand for community care as a cost-effective and quality solution to the care burden of aging populations will have country-specific impacts. When learning from other countries' best practices, in addition to researchers, policy makers should take full account of local and national care contexts.","[""Activities of Daily Living"",""Aged"",""Aging"",""Community Health Services"",""Europe"",""Financing, Government"",""Health Manpower"",""Health Services Accessibility"",""Health Services Research"",""Humans"",""Quality of Health Care"",""Residence Characteristics""]",,10.1093/eurpub/ckv152,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966429203,https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article-pdf/26/2/213/17359138/ckv152.pdf,0

Three case studies with different hydrogeological settings and located in two countries (Portugal and Italy) are used to derive NBL using the preselection method and validate the proposed methodology illustrating its main advantages over conventional statistical water quality analysis. Indicator kriging analysis was used to create probability maps of the three potential groundwater contaminants. The results clearly indicate the areas within a groundwater body that are potentially contaminated because the concentrations exceed the drinking water standards or even the local NBL, and cannot be justified by geogenic origin. The combined methodology developed facilitates the management of groundwater quality because it allows for the spatial interpretation of NBL values.","[""Drinking water standards"",""Groundwater contaminants"",""Groundwater contamination"",""Hydrogeological settings"",""Indicator kriging"",""Natural background levels"",""Probability maps"",""Water quality analysis"",""Arsenic"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Groundwater"",""Iron"",""Italy"",""Manganese"",""Portugal"",""Spatial Analysis"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical"",""Water Quality""]","[""Groundwater contamination"",""Indicator kriging"",""Natural background level"",""Probability maps""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.06.184,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976558368,,0

Global Change Biology Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdReliance on fossil fuels is causing unprecedented climate change and is accelerating environmental degradation and global biodiversity loss. Together, climate change and biodiversity loss, if not averted urgently, may inflict severe damage on ecosystem processes, functions and services that support the welfare of modern societies. Increasing renewable energy deployment and expanding the current protected area network represent key solutions to these challenges, but conflicts may arise over the use of limited land for energy production as opposed to biodiversity conservation. Here, we compare recently identified core areas for the expansion of the global protected area network with the renewable energy potential available from land-based solar photovoltaic, wind energy and bioenergy (in the form of Miscanthus × giganteus). We show that these energy sources have very different biodiversity impacts and net energy contributions. The extent of risks and opportunities deriving from renewable energy development is highly dependent on the type of renewable source harvested, the restrictions imposed on energy harvest and the region considered, with Central America appearing at particularly high potential risk from renewable energy expansion. Without restrictions on power generation due to factors such as production and transport costs, we show that bioenergy production is a major potential threat to biodiversity, while the potential impact of wind and solar appears smaller than that of bioenergy. However, these differences become reduced when energy potential is restricted by external factors including local energy demand. Overall, we found that areas of opportunity for developing solar and wind energy with little harm to biodiversity could exist in several regions of the world, with the magnitude of potential impact being particularly dependent on restrictions imposed by local energy demand. The evidence provided here helps guide sustainable development of renewable energy and contributes to the targeting of global efforts in climate mitigation and biodiversity conservation.","[""Bio-energy"",""Conservation planning"",""Conservation prioritization"",""offsetting"",""Species richness"",""Trade off""]","[""bioenergy"",""conservation planning"",""environmental impact avoidance"",""offsetting"",""spatial conservation prioritization"",""species richness"",""trade-off""]",10.1111/gcbb.12299,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983009802,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/gcbb.12299,0

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background: Worldwide, dengue is an unrelenting economic and health burden. Dengue outbreaks have become increasingly common, which place great strain on health infrastructure and services. Early warning models could allow health systems and vector control programmes to respond more cost-effectively and efficiently. Methodology/Principal Findings: The Shewhart method and Endemic Channel were used to identify alarm variables that may predict dengue outbreaks. Five country datasets were compiled by epidemiological week over the years 2007-2013. These data were split between the years 2007-2011 (historic period) and 2012-2013 (evaluation period). Associations between alarm/ outbreak variables were analysed using logistic regression during the historic period while alarm and outbreak signals were captured during the evaluation period. These signals were combined to form alarm/ outbreak periods, where 2 signals were equal to 1 period. Alarm periods were quantified and used to predict subsequent outbreak periods. Across Mexico and Dominican Republic, an increase in probable cases predicted outbreaks of hospitalised cases with sensitivities and positive predictive values (PPV) of 93%/ 83% and 97%/ 86% respectively, at a lag of 1-12 weeks. An increase in mean temperature ably predicted outbreaks of hospitalised cases in Mexico and Brazil, with sensitivities and PPVs of 79%/ 73% and 81%/ 46% respectively, also at a lag of 1-12 weeks. Mean age was predictive of hospitalised cases at sensitivities and PPVs of 72%/ 74% and 96%/ 45% in Mexico and Malaysia respectively, at a lag of 4-16 weeks. Conclusions/Significance: An increase in probable cases was predictive of outbreaks, while meteorological variables, particularly mean temperature, demonstrated predictive potential in some countries, but not all. While it is difficult to define uniform variables applicable in every country context, the use of probable cases and meteorological variables in tailored early warning systems could be used to highlight the occurrence of dengue outbreaks or indicate increased risk of dengue transmission.","[""Asia"",""Dengue"",""Disease Outbreaks"",""Hospitalization"",""Humans"",""Latin America"",""Models, Statistical"",""Seasons""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0157971,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977591641,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157971&type=printable,0

However, a reliable and rigorous cost-optimal analysis is an arduous and computationally-expensive issue, especially for complex buildings such as hospitals. The paper tackles this issue by providing a novel methodology to identify robust cost-optimal energy retrofit solutions. Multi-stage and multi-objective (Pareto) optimization is performed with the aim of minimizing the computational burden required to achieve reliable outcomes. The methodology combines EnergyPlus and MATLAB® and includes two optimization stages, preceded by a preliminary energy investigation that performs Latin hypercube sampling and sensitivity analysis. The preliminary investigation and the first optimization stage, which runs a genetic algorithm, aim at detecting efficient energy retrofit measures (ERMs) to reduce thermal energy demand for space heating and cooling. In the second optimization stage, these ERMs are combined with further ERMs, addressed to improve the efficiency of energy systems and to exploit renewable energy sources. Investment cost, primary energy consumption and global cost related to the resulting retrofit packages are investigated by means of smart exhaustive sampling. Finally, the cost-optimal solution is identified both in presence of a limitless economic availability and of limited budgets. The methodology is applied to a hospital reference building (RB), which represents hospitals built in South Italy between 1991 and 2005. The RB is defined by using an original approach, as required by the complexity of the examined building category. The achieved cost-optimal retrofit packages imply a reduction of primary energy consumption up to 67.9 kW h/m2 a (12.2%) and of global cost up to 2932 k€ (24.5%) with a maximum investment of 1236 k€.","[""Building energy"",""Energy performance of buildings"",""Hospital buildings"",""Latin hypercube sampling"",""Optimal analysis"",""Pareto genetic algorithms"",""Primary energy consumption"",""Renewable energy source""]","[""Building energy retrofit"",""Building sampling"",""Cost-optimal analysis"",""Hospital buildings"",""Pareto genetic algorithm"",""Reference building""]",10.1016/j.apenergy.2016.04.078,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963864112,,0

All rights reserved.Hydrogen is the ideal candidate to fulfill the growing energy demand in a sustainable manner because of its high energy content and no emission of greenhouse gases from its combustion. Currently most of hydrogen generation techniques involve the employment of fossil fuels, with consequent production of toxic greenhouse gases. The possibility to produce hydrogen by means of photocatalytic processes using the solar radiation as energy source fits in perfectly with the switch to a more sustainable energy production. The solar photocatalytic hydrogen generation can be achieved by reforming organic substances contained in civil or industrial wastewaters. This could allow to combine water decontamination with production of an energy carrier starting from a renewable source, the solar radiation. Within this perspective, a novel nano-TiO2 photocatalytic system based on the solar reforming of formic acid in presence of cupric ions and chlorides has been investigated. The effect on hydrogen generation rate of the initial concentrations of formic acid, chloride and cupric ion, and pH values has been evaluated. For both formic acid and chloride ions, at least up to a starting concentration of 103 mM, the higher the initial concentration, the higher the rate of hydrogen generation. Hydrogen production has turned out to be noticeably dependent on cupric ion concentration. An almost opposite behavior has been found varying the starting cupric ion concentration in the range 2.5-20 mM, with the highest value of hydrogen production rate recorded for Cu(II) initial concentration equal to 5.0 mM. The pH value has been identified to be a crucial parameter of the system. A decrease in hydrogen production has been also observed rising pH of the solution from 1.0 to 4.0. A characterization of the solid samples recovered at the end of the runs has been performed by X-ray Diffractometry. These experimental outcomes have been rationalized within a consistent reaction mechanism able to predict the system behavior under different operating conditions. This work opens the way to the development of new competitive processes able to use waste organic streams for hydrogen generation through photacatalytic system based on solar energy.","[""Different operating conditions"",""Hydrogen production rate"",""Nano-sized TiO"",""Photo-reduction"",""Photocatalytic hydrogen"",""Photocatalytic process"",""Photocatalytic reforming"",""Simulated solar radiations""]","[""Copper \""in-situ\"" photoreduction"",""Hydrogen production"",""Nano-sized TiO2; photocatalyst"",""Photocatalytic reforming"",""Solar photocatalytic processes""]",10.1016/j.apcata.2015.09.020,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964661185,,0

Mucosal CD4+ T-cell responses have been shown to be essential for vaccine-induced protection against H. pylori infection. The current study addresses the influence of the adjuvant and site of mucosal immunization on early CD4+ T-cell priming to H. pylori antigens. The vaccine formulation consisted of H. pylori lysate antigens and mucosal adjuvants, cholera toxin (CT) or a detoxified double-mutant heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli (dmLT), which were administered by either the sublingual or intragastric route. We report that in vitro, adjuvants CT and dmLT induce up-regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression in purified dendritic cells and enhance the H. pylori-specific CD4+ T-cell response including interleukin-17A (IL-17A), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion. In vivo, sublingual immunization led to an increased frequency of IL-17A+, IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+ secreting CD4+ T cells in the cervical lymph nodes compared with in the mesenteric lymph nodes after intragastric immunization. Subsequently, IL-17A+ cells were visualized in the stomach of sublingually immunized and challenged mice. In summary, our results suggest that addition of an adjuvant to the vaccine clearly activated dendritic cells, which in turn, enhanced CD4+ T-cell cytokines IL-17A, IFN-γ and TNF-α responses, particularly in the cervical lymph nodes after sublingual vaccination.","[""Adjuvants, Immunologic"",""Administration, Sublingual"",""Animals"",""Antigens, Bacterial"",""Bacterial Toxins"",""Bacterial Vaccines"",""CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"",""Cells, Cultured"",""Cholera Toxin"",""Cytokines"",""Dendritic Cells"",""Enterotoxins"",""Escherichia coli Proteins"",""Female"",""Helicobacter Infections"",""Helicobacter pylori"",""Immunity, Mucosal"",""Inflammation Mediators"",""Intubation, Gastrointestinal"",""Lymphocyte Activation"",""Mice"",""Mice, Inbred C57BL""]","[""cytokines"",""dendritic cells"",""mucosa"",""T cells"",""vaccination""]",10.1111/imm.12676,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84997785075,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/imm.12676,0

American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.Aircraft and satellite observations indicate the presence of ppt (ppt ≡ pmol/mol) levels of BrO in the free troposphere with important implications for the tropospheric budgets of ozone, OH, and mercury. We can reproduce these observations with the GEOS-Chem global tropospheric chemistry model by including a broader consideration of multiphase halogen (Br-Cl) chemistry than has been done in the past. Important reactions for regenerating BrO from its nonradical reservoirs include HOBr + Br-/Cl- in both aerosols and clouds, and oxidation of Br- by ClNO3 and ozone. Most tropospheric BrO in the model is in the free troposphere, consistent with observations and originates mainly from the photolysis and oxidation of ocean-emitted CHBr3. Stratospheric input is also important in the upper troposphere. Including production of gas phase inorganic bromine from debromination of acidified sea salt aerosol increases free tropospheric Bry by about 30%. We find HOBr to be the dominant gas-phase reservoir of inorganic bromine.

This article is focused on generating a general mapping of the literature and on identifying the best practices in compliance with LCA framework and proposing directions for future LCA studies in this field. The temporal evolution of the research in this field and the aim of the studies have grown in parallel with the legal framework related to waste and energy efficiency of buildings. Most studies have been published in Europe, followed by USA. Asia and Australia, being at an incipient application stage to the rest of the world. Topics related to ""LCA of buildings, including their EoL"" and ""LCA of general CDW management strategies"" are the most frequently analysed, followed by ""LCA of EoL of construction elements"" and ""LCA of natural material vs recycled material"". Regarding the strategies, recycling off-site and incineration, both combined with landfill for the rejected fractions, are the most commonly applied. Re-use or recycling on-site is the strategy least applied. The key aspect when LCA is applied to evaluate CDW management systems is the need to normalise which processes to include in the system boundary and the functional unit, the use of inventory data adapted to the context of the case study and the definition of a common set of appropriate impact assessment categories. Also, it is important to obtain results disaggregated by unit processes. This will allow the comparison between case studies.","[""Construction and demolition waste"",""Construction elements"",""Environmental performance"",""Impact assessments"",""Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)"",""Management strategies"",""Management systems"",""Recycled materials"",""Construction Materials"",""Recycling"",""Refuse Disposal"",""Solid Waste"",""Waste Management""]","[""CDW"",""Construction and demolition waste"",""LCA"",""Life cycle assessment"",""Review""]",10.1016/j.wasman.2016.01.036,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961773532,,0

In the city of Kisumu in Kenya, waste management is fragmented and insufficient with most household waste remaining uncollected. Solid waste enters and leaves public space through an intricate web of connected, mostly informal, actions. This article scrutinizes waste management of informal settlements, based on the case of Kisumu, to identify weak links in waste management chains and find neighborhood responses to bridge these gaps. Systems theory and action net theory support our analysis to understand the actions, actors, and processes associated with waste and its management. We use qualitative data from fieldwork and hands on engagement in waste management in Kisumu. Our main conclusion is that new waste initiatives should build on existing waste management practices already being performed within informal settlements by waste scavengers, waste pickers, waste entrepreneurs, and community-based organizations.",,"[""action net"",""household waste"",""informal settlement"",""Kenya"",""Kisumu"",""solid waste management"",""system dynamics""]",10.1177/1070496516672263,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011584132,,0

All rights reserved.A number of scholars are currently arguing that migration may have an important role in the reduction of inequality. It has happened before and it may also happen in the future, as it is possible and desirable. However, migration in itself does not resolve the issue of inequalities. At most, it would shift it forward, because redistribution through immigration does not exempt from previously creating a basic set of rules and institutions aimed at stimulating a major cooperation by countries to change the legal management systems of migration and correct their redistributive effects. In light of these studies, the present paper focuses on the regional impact of internal migration and attempts to demonstrate, with reference to the Italian case, how out-migration can increase income inequalities, thus hindering economic growth, while immigration can reduce income inequalities and mitigate economic imbalances. From a juridical point of view, we study the regional restrictions related to residence workers protection, the free movement of European workers and the welfare benefits for migrants.",,"[""Administrative citizenship for migrants"",""Income inequality"",""Migration"",""Redistribution through immigration""]",10.5559/di.25.4.02,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007374091,https://hrcak.srce.hr/file/252651,0

One of the first conditions allowing the capture of a particle by an air bubble is surface hydrophobicity. An alkylammonium bromide surfactant (TTAB) was used to perform in situ hydrophobication of negatively charged illite clay particles. This treatment causes the neutralization of clay surface charge and the irreversible aggregation of particles. At a fixed amount of TTAB in solution, foams generated from illite clay suspensions present a better foaming ability and stability than bare TTAB solutions. The relative quantity of TTAB necessary to reach the ""ideal foaming ability"" corresponding to the capture of all injected gas by the foam decreased when clay concentration increased. Capture and collision probability increase may explain this phenomenon. Moreover, selectivity for the smallest clay particle size fraction (3 μm) in foams was observed and is correlated with foam height and drainage time.","[""Bromide surfactants"",""Clay concentration"",""Clay suspensions"",""Collision probability"",""Irreversible aggregation"",""Mineral processing"",""Negatively charged"",""Surface hydrophobicity""]",,10.1021/acs.iecr.5b04450,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959319902,,0

Methods: Currently, there is no national classification of TC in Sweden. In this study, 7 university hospitals (UHs) in Sweden were selected to represent a TC level I or level II. These UHs have similar capabilities as the definition for level I and level II TC in the United States. Major trauma was defined as Injury Severity Score (ISS) > 15. A total of 117,730 patients who were transported by road or air ambulance were selected from the Swedish TRaffic Accident Data Acquisition (STRADA) database between 2007 to 2014. An analysis of the patient characteristics sustaining major trauma in comparison with patients sustaining minor trauma (ISS < 15) was conducted. Major trauma patients transported to a TC versus non-TC were further analysed with respect to injured body region and road user type. Results: Approximately 3% (n = 3, 411) of patients sustained major trauma. Thirty-eight percent of major trauma patients were transported to a TC, and 62% were transported to a non-TC. This results in large proportions of patients with Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) 3+ injuries being transported to a non-TC. The number of AIS 3+ head injuries for major trauma patients transported to a TC versus non-TC were similar, whereas a larger number of AIS 3+ thorax injuries were present in the non-TC group. The non-TC major trauma patients had a higher probability of traveling in a car, truck, or bus and to be involved in a crash in a rural location. Conclusions: Our results show that the majority of RTC major trauma patients are transported to a non-TC. This may cause unnecessary morbidity and mortality.

To assess the importance of algal and heterotrophic food resources for zooplankton during G. semen blooms and the effects of zooplankton diets on a higher consumer, we analyzed the fatty acid composition of zooplankton and the invertebrate predator Chaoborus flavicans from eight lakes along a gradient in the predominance of G. semen relative to other algae and the duration of G. semen blooms. The proportion of fatty acids of bacterial origin increased significantly along the G. semen gradient in all consumers studied. In addition, the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) decreased in cladocerans. These results suggest that heterotrophic pathways can compensate for a reduced trophic coupling between phytoplankton and filter-feeding zooplankton. The lower PUFA content in cladoceran prey from lakes at the higher end of the G. semen gradient did not affect the PUFA content of the predator C. flavicans, suggesting selective assimilation and retention of PUFA and/or feeding on other, more PUFA-rich prey.",,,10.1002/lno.10296,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84986879570,https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/lno.10296,0

Methods: We designed a prospective international 7-day cohort study of outcomes following elective adult inpatient surgery in 27 countries. The primary outcome was in-hospital complications. Secondary outcomes were death following a complication (failure to rescue) and death in hospital. Process measures were admission to critical care immediately after surgery or to treat a complication and duration of hospital stay. A single definition of critical care was used for all countries. Results: A total of 474 hospitals in 19 high-, 7 middle- and 1 low-income country were included in the primary analysis. Data included 44 814 patients with a median hospital stay of 4 (range 2-7) days. A total of 7508 patients (16.8%) developed one or more postoperative complication and 207 died (0.5%). The overall mortality among patients who developed complications was 2.8%. Mortality following complications ranged from 2.4% for pulmonary embolism to 43.9% for cardiac arrest.

These particles lead to plant malfunctions, increased equipment abrasion and accumulation in the digester. It is possible to remove these small impurities before or during the fermentation process but this requires additional equipment at the waste treatment facilities. For pretreated biowaste with fairly low concentrations of impurities and small particle sizes no appropriate method was found in literature to determine these particles. Therefore various approaches to develop an appropriate method were tested and finally one method was selected. Sample mass calculation showed that for the determination of impurities >2 mm a sample mass of about 6 kg is required to receive statistically sound result. Firstly an elutriation step is used to concentrate the impurities in a sinking fraction, still containing some organic material. The elutriated material is then dried. After drying the elutriated material, impurities can be fairly easily sorted manually. The elutriation process is applicable for the determination of impurities >1 mm. Due to the difficult manual sorting of particles <2 mm and the reduced sample mass required for the determination of particles <2 mm, these particles are determined by a different procedure: A sample mass of about 1 kg is dried and combusted in a muffle furnace. The remaining ashes are sieved from 2 to 0.06 mm. Particles <0.06 mm were not considered as impurities. The data regarding the impurities content and particle size distribution in food- and biowaste are required for assessing separation options as well as the behavior of stones or sand in the digester. This allows describing the quality of the pretreated biowaste. Furthermore the need to adopt or improve the existing pretreatment can be identified and the impact to the fermentation process (impurities accumulated in the digester, etc.) can be evaluated.","[""Additional equipment"",""Bio-waste"",""Codigestion"",""Fermentation process"",""Impurities contents"",""Mechanical pre-treatment"",""Mechanical treatments"",""Small particle size"",""Biodegradation, Environmental"",""Fermentation"",""Refuse Disposal"",""Waste Products""]","[""Biowaste"",""Co-digestion"",""Impurities determination"",""Mechanical pretreatment"",""Wet fermentation""]",10.1016/j.wasman.2016.03.055,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979461464,,0

Mucosal CD4+ T-cell responses have been shown to be essential for vaccine-induced protection against H. pylori infection. The current study addresses the influence of the adjuvant and site of mucosal immunization on early CD4+ T-cell priming to H. pylori antigens. The vaccine formulation consisted of H. pylori lysate antigens and mucosal adjuvants, cholera toxin (CT) or a detoxified double-mutant heat-labile enterotoxin from Escherichia coli (dmLT), which were administered by either the sublingual or intragastric route. We report that in vitro, adjuvants CT and dmLT induce up-regulation of pro-inflammatory gene expression in purified dendritic cells and enhance the H. pylori-specific CD4+ T-cell response including interleukin-17A (IL-17A), interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) secretion. In vivo, sublingual immunization led to an increased frequency of IL-17A+, IFN-γ+ and TNF-α+ secreting CD4+ T cells in the cervical lymph nodes compared with in the mesenteric lymph nodes after intragastric immunization. Subsequently, IL-17A+ cells were visualized in the stomach of sublingually immunized and challenged mice. In summary, our results suggest that addition of an adjuvant to the vaccine clearly activated dendritic cells, which in turn, enhanced CD4+ T-cell cytokines IL-17A, IFN-γ and TNF-α responses, particularly in the cervical lymph nodes after sublingual vaccination.","[""Adjuvants, Immunologic"",""Administration, Sublingual"",""Animals"",""Antigens, Bacterial"",""Bacterial Toxins"",""Bacterial Vaccines"",""CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes"",""Cells, Cultured"",""Cholera Toxin"",""Cytokines"",""Dendritic Cells"",""Enterotoxins"",""Escherichia coli Proteins"",""Female"",""Helicobacter Infections"",""Helicobacter pylori"",""Immunity, Mucosal"",""Inflammation Mediators"",""Intubation, Gastrointestinal"",""Lymphocyte Activation"",""Mice"",""Mice, Inbred C57BL""]","[""cytokines"",""dendritic cells"",""mucosa"",""T cells"",""vaccination""]",10.1111/imm.12676,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84997785075,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/imm.12676,0

This paper addresses some main aspects of the process-oriented current knowledge on phagotrophic, i.e. heterotrophic and mixotrophic, protists in aquatic food webs. This is not an exhaustive review; rather, we focus on conceptual issues, in particular on the numerical and functional response of these organisms. We discuss the evolution of concepts and define parameters to evaluate predator–prey dynamics ranging from Lotka–Volterra to the Independent Response Model. Since protists have extremely versatile feeding modes, we explore if there are systematic differences related to their taxonomic affiliation and life strategies. We differentiate between intrinsic factors (nutritional history, acclimatisation) and extrinsic factors (temperature, food, turbulence) affecting feeding, growth, and survival of protist populations. We briefly consider intraspecific variability of some key parameters and constraints inherent in laboratory microcosm experiments. We then upscale the significance of phagotrophic protists in food webs to the ocean level. Finally, we discuss limitations of the mechanistic understanding of protist functional ecology resulting from principal unpredictability of nonlinear dynamics. We conclude by defining open questions and identifying perspectives for future research on functional ecology of aquatic phagotrophic protists.","[""Aquatic Organisms"",""Biological Evolution"",""Eukaryota"",""Hydrobiology"",""Models, Biological"",""Research""]","[""Functional response"",""Independent Response Model"",""Mixotrophy"",""Nonlinear dynamics"",""Numerical response"",""Protist grazing""]",10.1016/j.ejop.2016.03.003,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963556374,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejop.2016.03.003,0

The environmentality literature emphasizes the institutional architecture of emergent science-policy regimes and how scientific research is used in political settings, creating new modes of governance and subjectivities. However, there has been relatively little attention to domain-level socio-ecological assessments as socially produced technologies where specific scientific choices are mechanisms connecting governance architecture and popular subjectivities. Combining empirical case study and literature review, assessment technologies are analyzed in three domains: vulnerability assessment, ecosystem services assessment, life-cycle assessment. Using conceptualization, operationalization, and institutionalization as analytical lenses, the cases illustrate ways that scientific choices simplify complex socio-ecological relationships with implications for both governance practices and subjectivities.

This study compares historical and recent records of the deep-water Mediterranean kelp Laminaria rodriguezii in the Adriatic Sea. Historical records include data from herbarium collections and trawling fishery expeditions in the mid-twentieth century, while recent data comprise records of the last 17 years from MEDITS expeditions, ROV surveys of historical kelp locations, benthic surveys and records by fishermen. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that the Adriatic population of L. rodriguezii has suffered a decline of more than 85 % of its historical range and is now present only around the small offshore island of Palagruža. Bottom trawling activities are presumably responsible for the disappearance elsewhere. We propose to classify L. rodriguezii as “Endangered” in the Adriatic Sea under IUCN criteria B1ab(i,iii,iv), ver 3.1. Oceanographic characteristics of the habitat suggest that besides high water transparency, presence of North Adriatic Dense Water with both strong currents and stable low temperatures of around 14 °C are essential oceanographic factors for the development of L. rodriguezii in the Central Adriatic. The origin of cold water thus differs from that at upwelling sites permitting populations of tropical deep-water kelps. The phylogenetic position of L. rodriguezii is so far unknown.

We sought to develop and validate a model of clinical characteristics to predict 6-month mortality in IE. Methods and Results-Using a large multinational prospective registry of definite IE (International Collaboration on Endocarditis [ICE]-Prospective Cohort Study [PCS], 2000-2006, n=4049), a model to predict 6-month survival was developed by Cox proportional hazards modeling with inverse probability weighting for surgery treatment and was internally validated by the bootstrapping method. This model was externally validated in an independent prospective registry (ICE-PLUS, 2008-2012, n=1197). The 6-month mortality was 971 of 4049 (24.0%) in the ICE-PCS cohort and 342 of 1197 (28.6%) in the ICE-PLUS cohort. Surgery during the index hospitalization was performed in 48.1% and 54.0% of the cohorts, respectively. In the derivation model, variables related to host factors (age, dialysis), IE characteristics (prosthetic or nosocomial IE, causative organism, left-sided valve vegetation), and IE complications (severe heart failure, stroke, paravalvular complication, and persistent bacteremia) were independently associated with 6-month mortality, and surgery was associated with a lower risk of mortality (Harrell's C statistic 0.715). In the validation model, these variables had similar hazard ratios (Harrell's C statistic 0.682), with a similar, independent benefit of surgery (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.62-0.89). A simplified risk model was developed by weight adjustment of these variables.

All rights reserved.The building of the Edinburgh New Town, from the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, was a major advance in harmonious and elegant town planning. However, there is anecdotal evidence that it led to the occurrence of an epidemic of silicosis/tuberculosis among the stonemasons. We have reviewed contemporary accounts of the episode and early records of the understanding of silicosis. We have also studied the lung of a contemporary stonemason, preserved in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and confirmed the presence of silico-tuberculosis in it. The evidence shows that a major epidemic did occur, caused by a combination of factors. The size of the undertaking attracted many stonemasons to Edinburgh over a period of almost 100 years, intensively cutting and dressing stone. The principal stone worked was a very high-quartz sandstone, derived from the local Craigleith quarry, having properties that made it desirable for prestige buildings. However, even before the construction of the New Town, Craigleith sandstone was notorious for its dustiness and the Edinburgh stonemasons worked the stone in unventilated sheds. Stonemasons appeared to be aware of the risk of their trade, but little was known about preventive measures. It appears it was assumed that the risks to stonemasons disappeared after the Craigleith quarry closed, the employers emphasising (without evidence) the lack of health risks in other quarries, and the tragic episode appears to have been forgotten. However, we point to the continuing occurrence of silicosis among stonemasons to the present day; the importance of remembering such episodes is stressed lest the lessons of the past be forgotten.","[""Cities"",""Construction Industry"",""Dust"",""Epidemics"",""History, 18th Century"",""History, 19th Century"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Scotland"",""Silicosis"",""Tuberculosis, Pulmonary""]","[""Edinburgh"",""New Town"",""Quartz"",""Silica"",""Silicosis"",""Stonemasons"",""Tuberculosis""]",10.4997/JRCPE.2017.416,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85037663424,https://doi.org/10.4997/jrcpe.2017.416,0

In the Gulf of Alaska, a regime shift in the late 1970s was observed, indicated by an abrupt increase in sea surface temperature and major shifts in the catch of many fish species. A thorough understanding of the extent and mechanisms leading to such regime shifts is challenged by data paucity in time and space. We investigate the ability of a suite of ocean biogeochemistry models of varying complexity to simulate regime shifts in the Gulf of Alaska by examining the presence of abrupt changes in time series of physical variables (sea surface temperature and mixed-layer depth), nutrients and biological variables (chlorophyll, primary productivity and plankton biomass) using change-point analysis. Our results show that some ocean biogeochemical models are capable of simulating the late 1970s shift, manifested as an abrupt increase in sea surface temperature followed by an abrupt decrease in nutrients and biological productivity. Models from low to intermediate complexity simulate an abrupt transition in the late 1970s (i.e. a significant shift from one year to the next) while the transition is smoother in higher complexity models. Our study demonstrates that ocean biogeochemical models can successfully simulate regime shifts in the Gulf of Alaska region. These models can therefore be considered useful tools to enhance our understanding of how changes in physical conditions are propagated from lower to upper trophic levels.",,,10.5194/bg-13-4533-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982179579,https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/4533/2016/bg-13-4533-2016.pdf,0

Despite the well documented disease burden, the economic burden of physical inactivity remains unquantified at the global level. A better understanding of the economic burden could help to inform resource prioritisation and motivate efforts to increase levels of physical activity worldwide. Methods Direct health-care costs, productivity losses, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to physical inactivity were estimated with standardised methods and the best data available for 142 countries, representing 93·2% of the world's population. Direct health-care costs and DALYs were estimated for coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and colon cancer attributable to physical inactivity. Productivity losses were estimated with a friction cost approach for physical inactivity related mortality. Analyses were based on national physical inactivity prevalence from available countries, and adjusted population attributable fractions (PAFs) associated with physical inactivity for each disease outcome and all-cause mortality. Findings Conservatively estimated, physical inactivity cost health-care systems international $ (INT$) 53·8 billion worldwide in 2013, of which $31·2 billion was paid by the public sector, $12·9 billion by the private sector, and $9·7 billion by households. In addition, physical inactivity related deaths contribute to $13·7 billion in productivity losses, and physical inactivity was responsible for 13·4 million DALYs worldwide. High-income countries bear a larger proportion of economic burden (80·8% of health-care costs and 60·4% of indirect costs), whereas low-income and middle-income countries have a larger proportion of the disease burden (75·0% of DALYs). Sensitivity analyses based on less conservative assumptions led to much higher estimates. Interpretation In addition to morbidity and premature mortality, physical inactivity is responsible for a substantial economic burden. This paper provides further justification to prioritise promotion of regular physical activity worldwide as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce non-communicable diseases.

A field experiment, embedded in a survey (n = 1887), sought to test out how the participants responded to risk frames in which a story on flood was either or not combined with climate change information. The results show that it was possible to increase the participants’ local climate risk perception in combination with increased motivation for flood damage prevention, despite a certain level of climate change skepticism.

Its increasing detection during Ostreopsis blooms and in seafood highlights the need to characterize its toxic effects and to set up appropriate detection methods. OVTX-a is about 100 fold less potent than PLTX in reducing HaCaT cells viability (EC50 = 1.1 × 10-9 M vs 1.8 × 10-11 M, MTT test) in agreement with a reduced binding affinity (Kd = 1.2 × 10-9 vs 2.7 × 10-11 M, saturation experiments on intact cells). Similarly, OVTX-a hemolytic effect is lower than that of the reference PLTX compound. Ost-D shows the lowest cytotoxicity toward HaCaT keratinocytes, suggesting the lack of a hydroxyl group at C44 as a critical feature for PLTXs cytotoxic effects.

In the present study, we analyze the major agricultural challenges identified by European farmers (primarily related to biotic stresses) in 13 countries, namely Belgium, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, UK and Turkey, for nine major crops (barley, beet, grapevine, maize, oilseed rape, olive, potato, sunflower and wheat). Most biotic stresses (BSs) are related to fungi or insects, but viral diseases, bacterial diseases and even parasitic plants have an important impact on yield and harvest quality. We examine how these challenges have been addressed by public and private research sectors, using either conventional breeding, marker-assisted selection, transgenesis, cisgenesis, RNAi technology or mutagenesis. Both national surveys and scientific literature analysis followed by text mining were employed to evaluate genetic engineering (GE) and non-GE approaches. This is the first report of text mining of the scientific literature on plant breeding and agricultural biotechnology research. For the nine major crops in Europe, 128 BS challenges were identified with 40% of these addressed neither in the scientific literature nor in recent European public research programs. We found evidence that the private sector was addressing only a few of these “neglected” challenges. Consequently, there are considerable gaps between farmer’s needs and current breeding and biotechnology research. We also provide evidence that the current political situation in certain European countries is an impediment to GE research in order to address these agricultural challenges in the future. This study should also contribute to the decision-making process on future pertinent international consortia to fill the identified research gaps.","[""Biotic stress"",""breeding"",""cisgenesis"",""Directed mutagenesis"",""Literature analysis"",""Marker-assisted selection"",""patent"",""Text mining"",""Transgenesis"",""Agriculture"",""Animals"",""Biotechnology"",""Crops, Agricultural"",""Europe"",""Farmers"",""Genetic Engineering"",""Humans"",""Research"",""Stress, Physiological""]","[""Automated literature analysis"",""biotic stress"",""breeding"",""cisgenesis"",""marker-assisted selection"",""oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis"",""patent"",""text mining"",""transgenesis""]",10.3109/07388551.2015.1055707,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84938674643,,0

Children leaving home for street or domestic work are especially vulnerable. Strategies for facilitating reintegration for these children are advocated, but enough is still not known about the outcome of such reintegration in terms of violence and abuse. The study aimed at examining the extent of violence against children who have left home in Kagera Region, Tanzania as well as in different stages of their trajectory of life, i.e. before leaving home, on the street, as domestic workers, and after reintegration. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 214 participants aged 13–24, who had earlier left their homes and had now been reintegrated into the local community for at least one year. The study also examined the residual violence still taking place after reintegration and its potential impact on their psychological quality of life. This study, first of its kind in the country measuring level of violence for children who have left home as well as after reintegration, offered a unique opportunity to compare level of violence with other nationally conducted studies on violence against children recruited from the home setting. The result showed a significantly higher overall prevalence of violence against the children who left home compared to the national average. After reintegration, the overall prevalence of violence had declined significantly (p-value < 0.001) and to the same level as the national average, showing that reintegration can be successful.

We test the hypothesis that the termite community is affected by the identity of the tree species used in reforestation. More precisely, we test whether the reforestation of a native species of fig (Ficus sp) is more efficient in restoring biodiversity than reforestation of exotic teak trees (Tectona grandis). We sampled the termite community in these reforested areas and three other different “control” areas: active pastures, abandoned pastures (secondary forests) and mature pristine forest. We found that the distance of reforestation from the nearest primary forest had no effect on termite biodiversity, at the scale studied. But, as expected, richness and the abundance were higher in the mature forest, intermediate in reforestation areas, and lower in secondary forest and pastures. In fact, the only studied habitat with biodiversity comparable to the mature forest was the fig plantations. The guild composition in reforested areas was also similar to that of the mature forest. The diversity and abundance of humivorous termites was particularly pronounced in the reforestation areas compared with pasture or secondary forests. The humivorous guild provides important functional services, since its action makes nitrogen and other nutrients available to the plants along ecological succession.

Whilst global flood risk models exist for this purpose, the accuracy of their results is greatly limited by the lack of information on the current standard of protection to floods, with studies either neglecting this aspect or resorting to crude assumptions. Here we present a first global database of FLOod PROtection Standards, FLOPROS, which comprises information in the form of the flood return period associated with protection measures, at different spatial scales. FLOPROS comprises three layers of information, and combines them into one consistent database. The design layer contains empirical information about the actual standard of existing protection already in place; the policy layer contains information on protection standards from policy regulations; and the model layer uses a validated modelling approach to calculate protection standards. The policy layer and the model layer can be considered adequate proxies for actual protection standards included in the design layer, and serve to increase the spatial coverage of the database. Based on this first version of FLOPROS, we suggest a number of strategies to further extend and increase the resolution of the database. Moreover, as the database is intended to be continually updated, while flood protection standards are changing with new interventions, FLOPROS requires input from the flood risk community.

The underlying mechanisms, constraints and benefits of colour change are often unclear, but examining such factors offers insights into phenotypic plasticity. Here, we investigated the mechanisms behind how an aggressive reef fish mimic (bluestriped fangblenny Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos) changes colour rapidly (1–5 min) between mimetic and other colour forms. Black with one neon blue dorsal stripe (mimic), black with two neon blue stripes, brown, olive and orange forms differed in melanophore density. Fish skin biopsies were modulated in vitro by hormones, and smaller fangblennies changed coloration more rapidly than larger fish suggesting that the ability to change colour is diminished as fish get larger. Individuals may be limited by differences in pigment cell densities to change colour between extreme colour forms (black to orange); therefore, longer morphological changes may also occur or fangblennies may exhibit dimorphic populations. Behavioural observations suggest that small black and orange individuals were equally successful in attacking passing fish to feed on dermal tissue/scales, indicating that deceptive strategies used by each colour form may deliver equal fitness benefits. The present study demonstrates for the first time how fangblennies change colour and highlights that colour plasticity offers important adaptive advantage; however, physiological constraints should also be considered.",,"[""Aggressive mimicry"",""Bluestriped fangblenny"",""Colour change"",""Coral reef fish"",""Phenotypic plasticity"",""Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos""]",10.1093/biolinnean/blx057,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85030666443,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:682267/UQ682267_OA.pdf,0

In this study, the ECOSSE model was applied spatially to estimate GHG and soil organic carbon (SOC) fluxes from three major land uses (grass, arable and forest) in Wales. The aims of the simulations were: (1) to estimate the annual net GHG balance for Wales; (2) to investigate the efficiency of the reduced nitrogen (N) fertilizer goal of the sustainable land management scheme (Glastir), through which the Welsh Government offers financial support to farmers and land managers on GHG flux reduction; and (3) to investigate the effects of future climate change on the emissions of GHG and plant net primary production (NPP). Three climate scenarios were studied: baseline (1961–1990) and low and high emission climate scenarios (2015–2050). Results reveal that grassland and cropland are the major nitrous oxide (N2O) emitters and consequently emit more GHG to the atmosphere than forests. The overall average simulated annual net GHG balance for Wales under baseline climate (1961–1990) is equivalent to 0.2 t CO2e ha−1 y−1 which gives an estimate of total annual net flux for Wales of 0.34 Mt CO2e y−1. Reducing N fertilizer by 20 and 40 % could reduce annual net GHG fluxes by 7 and 25 %, respectively. If the current N fertilizer application rate continues, predicted climate change by the year 2050 would not significantly affect GHG emissions or NPP from soils in Wales.",,"[""Climate change"",""ECOSSE"",""Net primary productivity"",""Nitrogen fertilizer"",""Soil greenhouse gas balance"",""Wales""]",10.1007/s10113-016-0958-7,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964068010,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10113-016-0958-7.pdf,0

There are complex pollution sources of nitrogen (N) discharge in many river basins worldwide. Knowledge of its pollution sources and their respective load contributions is essential to developing effective N pollution control strategies. N loads from all known anthropogenic pollution sources in the Upper Huai River basin of China were simulated with the process-based SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. The performances of SWAT driven by daily and hourly rainfall inputs were assessed and it was found that the one driven by hourly rainfall outperformed the one driven by daily rainfall in simulating both total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4-N) loads. The hourly SWAT model was hence used to examine the spatiotemporal patterns of TN and NH4-N loads and their source attributions. TN load exhibited significant seasonal variations with the largest in summer and the smallest in spring. Despite its declining proportion of contribution downstream, crop production remained the largest contributor of TN load followed by septic tanks, concentrated animal feedlot operations (CAFOs), municipal sewage treatment plants, industries, and scattered animal feedlot operations (SAFOs). There was much less seasonal variation in NH4-N load. CAFOs remained the largest source of NH4-N load throughout the basin, while contributions from industries and municipal sewage treatment plants were more evident downstream. Our study results suggest the need to shift the focus of N load reduction from ""end-of-pipe"" sewage treatment to an integrated approach emphasizing stakeholder involvement and source prevention.","[""Huai rivers"",""Nitrogen loads"",""Pollution sources"",""Spatiotemporal patterns"",""SWAT"",""Agriculture"",""Ammonia"",""China"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Groundwater"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Nitrogen"",""Rivers"",""Seasons"",""Sewage"",""Spatio-Temporal Analysis"",""Water Pollution, Chemical""]","[""Hourly rainfall"",""Huai river"",""Nitrogen load"",""Pollution source attribution"",""Spatiotemporal pattern"",""SWAT""]",10.1016/j.watres.2016.02.040,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959326735,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/57377/2/Yang16_WW_Accepted_Manuscript.pdf,0

In this study, we investigated if increasing CO2 levels stimulate the intestinal acid-base regulatory machinery of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and whether temperatures at the upper limit of thermal tolerance stimulate or counteract ion regulatory capacities. Juvenile G. morhua were acclimated for 4 weeks to three CO2 levels (550, 1200, and 2200 μatm) covering present and near-future natural variability, at optimum (10°C) and summer maximum temperature (18°C), respectively. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed the subcellular localization of ion transporters, including Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), Na+/H+-exchanger 3 (NHE3), Na+/HCO3-cotransporter (NBC1), pendrin-like Cl-/HCO3-exchanger (SLC26a6), V-type H+-ATPase subunit a (VHA), and Cl- channel 3 (CLC3) in epithelial cells of the anterior intestine. At 10°C, proteins and mRNA were generally up-regulated for most transporters in the intestinal epithelium after acclimation to higher CO2 levels. This supports recent findings demonstrating increased intestinal HCO3-secretion rates in response to CO2 induced seawater acidification. At 18°C, mRNA expression and protein concentrations of most ion transporters remained unchanged or were even decreased, suggesting thermal compensation.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.There is an increasing interest to restore the ecosystem services that eelgrass provides, after their continuous worldwide decline. Most attempts to restore eelgrass using seeds are challenged by very high seed losses and the reasons for these losses are not all clear. We assess the impact of predation on seed loss and eelgrass establishment, and explore methods to decrease seed loss during restoration in the Swedish northwest coast. In a laboratory study we identified three previously undescribed seed predators, the shore crab Carcinus maenas, the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus droe-bachiensis, of which shore crabs consumed 2-7 times more seeds than the other two species. The importance of shore crabs as seed predators was supported in field cage experiments where one enclosed crab caused 73% loss of seeds over a 1-week period on average (∼21 seeds per day). Seedling establishment was significantly higher (14%) in cages that excluded predators over an 8-month period than in uncaged plots and cages that allowed predators but prevented seed-transport (0.5%), suggesting that seed predation constitutes a major source of seed loss in the study area. Burying the seeds 2 cm below the sediment surface prevented seed predation in the laboratory and decreased predation in the field, constituting a way to decrease seed loss during restoration. Shore crabs may act as a key feedback mechanism that prevent the return of eelgrass both by direct consumption of eelgrass seeds and as a predator of algal mesograzers, allowing algal mats to overgrow eelgrass beds. This shore crab feedback mechanism could become self-generating by promoting the growth of its own nursery habitat (algal mats) and by decreasing the nursery habitat (seagrass meadow) of its dominant predator (cod). This double feedback-loop is supported by a strong increase of shore crab abundance in the last decades and may partly explain the regime shift in vegetation observed along the Swedish west coast.","[""Animals"",""Anomura"",""Brachyura"",""Ecosystem"",""Poaceae"",""Predatory Behavior"",""Seeds"",""Strongylocentrotus""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0168128,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006257897,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168128&type=printable,0

Understanding the response of marine fauna to this change is critical for understanding the effects of OA. Population-level variation in OA tolerance is highly relevant and important in the determination of ecosystem resilience and persistence, but has received little focus to date. In this study, whether OA has the same biological consequences in high-salinity-acclimated population versus a low-salinity-acclimated population of the same species was investigated in the marine isopod Idotea balthica. The populations were found to have physiologically different responses to OA. While survival rate was similar between the two study populations at a future CO2 level of 1000 ppm, and both populations showed increased oxidative stress, the metabolic rate and osmoregulatory activity differed significantly between the two populations. The results of this study demonstrate that the physiological response to OA of populations from different salinities can vary.

Mercury is quickly transformed into oxidation products, which are subsequently removed by deposition. Here we show that such events also occur during Antarctic winter over sea ice areas, leading to additional deposition of mercury. Over four months in the Weddell Sea we measured gaseous elemental, oxidized, and particulate-bound mercury, as well as ozone in the troposphere and total and elemental mercury concentrations in snow, demonstrating a series of depletion and deposition events between July and September. The winter depletions in July were characterized by stronger correlations between mercury and ozone and larger formation of particulate-bound mercury in air compared to later spring events. It appears that light at large solar zenith angles is sufficient to initiate the photolytic formation of halogen radicals. We also propose a dark mechanism that could explain observed events in air masses coming from dark regions. Br2 that could be the main actor in dark conditions was possibly formed in high concentrations in the marine boundary layer in the dark. These high concentrations may also have caused the formation of high concentrations of CHBr3 and CH2I2 in the top layers of the Antarctic sea ice observed during winter. These new findings show that the extent of depletion events is larger than previously believed and that winter depletions result in additional deposition of mercury that could be transferred to marine and terrestrial ecosystems.","[""Antarctica"",""Atmospheric mercury"",""Depletion event"",""Gaseous elemental mercury"",""Marine boundary layers"",""Particulate bound mercury"",""Solar zenith angle"",""Terrestrial ecosystems""]","[""Antarctica"",""Depletion event"",""Mercury"",""Ozone"",""Sea ice""]",10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.01.023,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957895074,,0

Reported prognoses are heterogeneous, and the optimum treatment remains undefined. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of all patients who were treated for LCNEC in our Department of Thoracic Surgery between May 2005 and December 2013. Primary outcomes of interest were patient survival and prognostic factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine the significant predictors of overall survival. Results Within the prescribed period, 127 patients were treated for LCNEC, and 125 underwent surgical resection with curative intent. Induction chemotherapy or radiochemotherapy was given to 9 patients, and 63 patients received postoperative chemotherapy. Complete resection was achieved in 99.2%. The overall 1-, 3- and 5-year survival rates were 83.7%, 63.2%, and 53.8% of all patients, and the 5-year survival in patients at stages I, II, and III was 64.5%, 40%, and 29.7%.

Design Prospective cohort study. Methods This was a monetary cost analysis using the data prospectively gathered alongside the RRI registration in the NLstart2run study. RRI data were collected weekly. Cost diaries were applied two and six weeks after the RRI registration to collect data regarding healthcare utilisation (direct costs) and absenteeism from paid and unpaid work (indirect costs). RRI was defined as running-related pain that hampered running ability for three consecutive training sessions. Results From the 1696 participants included in the analysis, 185 reported a total of 272 RRIs. A total of 26.1% of the cost data (71 RRIs reported by 50 participants) were missing. Therefore, a multiple imputation procedure was performed.

However, very few studies have undertaken a quantitative comparison of entire food webs from a key consumer perspective across a broad geographical area, limiting relevant comparisons among systems with distinct biotic and abiotic components. We investigate the structure and functioning of food webs in four tidal ecosystems of international importance for migratory shorebirds along the East Atlantic Flyway: Tejo estuary in Portugal, Sidi Moussa in Morocco, Banc d'Arguin in Mauritania and Bijagós archipelago in Guinea-Bissau. Basal food sources, shorebirds and their prey (benthic invertebrates) were sampled in all areas, and Bayesian stable isotope mixing models and community-wide metrics were used in a comparative analysis among areas. Significant differences among study areas were found in the structure of food webs, as well as in the relative importance of basal resource pools supporting each food web. Overall, the food web of Banc d'Arguin was characterized by lower trophic diversity and higher functional redundancy than the other sites. This result might be explained by the low number of trophic pathways of organic matter transfer in this seagrass-dominated system which, as a fossil estuary, lacks inputs from both freshwater and nutrient-rich offshore oceanic waters. Structure of shorebird communities was consistent with the main organizational patterns found for each food web, highlighting the less diverse character of the community of Banc d'Arguin. At Banc d'Arguin and Bijagós archipelago, which displayed the smallest and largest isotopic niche widths in bird assemblage, respectively, mean niche overlap among species was low, suggesting high interspecific partitioning in resource use. Tropical systems typically offer comparatively lower harvestable prey biomass for shorebirds and might thus strengthen interspecific competition, leading to low niche overlap among species. Our study reveals relevant differences in the structure of food webs and shorebird communities in coastal areas along an avian flyway. While differences in trophic redundancy of food webs point to distinct levels of ecosystem resilience, contrasts in the organization of shorebird communities highlight the plasticity in the foraging behaviour of species inhabiting areas with distinct environmental conditions.",,"[""Bayesian mixing models and community metrics"",""Coastal tidal ecosystems"",""Migratory shorebirds"",""Trophic structure""]",10.1111/1365-2435.12506,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961120169,,0

We show that for a two-year (2012–2014) rainfall-runoff stable isotope record from almost daily sampling in a humid tropical 30 km2 catchment in southern Costa Rica, the MTTs are generally short (<one year), but exhibit distinct inter and intra-annual patterns. The drier year (2012–13), which was under the influence of El-Niño causing less precipitation, exhibited MTTs up to one year. In contrast, the wetter year (2013–14) resulted in MTT estimates <100 days. Similar patterns were found at an intra-annual scale: the dry season MTTs were on average 185 days and only 15 days during the wet season. This can be explained by high rainfall volumes (>3 m/year) and events occurring throughout the year, the seasonality of rainfall and distinct moisture origin (Pacific, Atlantic and land surface), the likely dominance of quick near-surface flow paths and relatively low subsurface storage of the underlying volcanic and sedimentary rocks. The moisture origin of rainfall was found to be the most dominant driver of time-variable TTDs as indicated by the changing average wind directions following the transition from the dry into the wet season. This isotope study revealed a highly dynamic system that is likely to be sensitive to environmental change.","[""Costa Rica"",""Gamma models"",""Humid tropics"",""Stable isotopes"",""Transit time""]","[""Costa Rica"",""Gamma model"",""Humid tropics"",""Stable isotopes"",""Time-variable transit time""]",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.09.006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992751339,,0

Here we show, based on existing hydrochemical and geochemical (sediment core) data and new detailed chemical and mineralogical characterization of a 3.5 m long sediment core from a Boreal estuary, that the behavior of Mn can be profoundly different and more complex in estuarine settings receiving an abundance of terrestrial Mn. The most notable feature in the 3.5 m long sediment core is two depth intervals (60-155 cm and 181-230 cm) where there are strong fine-scale variations in Mn concentrations with peaks episodically reaching up to 10-25 g kg-1 and 6.7-12 g kg-1, respectively. X-ray absorption spectroscopy and sequential chemical extraction show that Mn occurs mainly as authigenic rhodochrosite at these two depth intervals and is mainly surface-sorbed in other sections with relatively low and stable Mn concentrations. The data suggests that the strong fine-scale variations in Mn concentrations are a reflection of the extent of formation and settling of Mn hydroxides, the precursors of the authigenic rhodochrosite (and also of the surface-sorbed Mn), rather than Mn input to the estuary or redox-related Mn translocation within the sediment. There was agreement between the results of linear combination fitting of extended X-ray absorption fine structure data and a 7-step sequential chemical extraction (SCE) in terms of quantification of surface-sorbed Mn species, whereas the SCE experiment failed to fractionate a majority of rhodochrosite into SCE step-2 (1 M NH4-acetate at pH 6), which is frequently employed to dissolve carbonate. We ascribe this discrepancy to only partial dissolution of rhodochrosite in the weakly acidic (pH = 6) NH4-acetate leach.","[""Acid sulfate soils"",""Estuarine sediments"",""Extended x-ray absorption fine structure datum"",""Mineralogical characterization"",""Rhodochrosite"",""Sequential chemical extraction"",""Solid-phase speciation"",""Water sediment interface""]","[""Acid sulfate soil"",""Estuarine sediments"",""Mn speciation"",""Rhodochrosite"",""X-ray absorption spectroscopy""]",10.1016/j.chemgeo.2016.05.016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973131081,,0

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the diagnostic process, implementation of treatment and changes in life situation in patients with acromegaly, focusing on sex-specific differences. Methods: Non-interventional patient-reported outcome study. 165 patients with clinically and biochemically proven acromegaly were questioned about the diagnostic process and utilization of health care by means of a self-developed standardized postal survey including questions on acromegaly symptoms experienced before diagnosis, number and specialty of consulted doctors, time to diagnosis and aftercare. Results: The diagnostic process took 2.9 (SD 4.53) years, during which 3.4 (SD 2.99) physicians were consulted. Women waited longer [4.1 (SD 5.53) years] than men [1.6 (SD 2.69) years; p = 0.001] for the correct diagnosis, and consulted more doctors in the process [4.0 (SD 2.99) vs. 2.7 (SD 2.84) doctors, p < 0.001, respectively]. In 48.5 % of patients, acromegaly was diagnosed by an endocrinologist (men: 45.1 %; women: 52.4 %). Overall disease duration from symptom onset until last surgery was 5.5 (SD 6.85) years, with no sex differences. A change in employment status was the most commonly reported event after diagnosis and a quarter of the patients stated that the illness had changed their lives. Conclusions: Our findings confirm the urgent need to increase awareness of the clinical manifestation of acromegaly to facilitate an earlier diagnosis of the disease and to provide diagnostic equality across the sexes.","[""Adenoma"",""Adult"",""Aftercare"",""Antineoplastic Agents"",""Cranial Irradiation"",""Delayed Diagnosis"",""Female"",""Glucose Tolerance Test"",""Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma"",""Human Growth Hormone"",""Humans"",""Hypophysectomy"",""Insulin-Like Growth Factor I"",""Magnetic Resonance Imaging"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Patient Reported Outcome Measures"",""Patient Satisfaction"",""Referral and Consultation"",""Sex Factors"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Time Factors""]","[""Acromegaly"",""Diagnosis"",""Impairment"",""Patient’s perspective"",""Treatment""]",10.1007/s11102-015-0702-1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84953438948,,0

The aim of this paper is to describe the current status of international collaboration in medical radiation science and compare this to other allied health occupations. Methods: This study utilised a content analysis approach where co-authorship of a journal article was used as a proxy for research collaboration and the papers were assigned to countries based on the corporate address given in the by-line of the publication. A convenience sample method was employed and articles published in the professional medical radiation science journals in the countries represented within our research team – Australia, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) were sampled. Physiotherapy, speech pathology, occupational therapy and nursing were chosen for comparison. Results: Rates of international collaboration in medical radiation science journals from Australia, the UK and the USA have steadily increased over the 3-year period sampled. Medical radiation science demonstrated lower average rates of international collaboration than the other allied health occupations sampled. The average rate of international collaboration in nursing was far below that of the allied health occupations sampled. Overall, the UK had the highest average rate of international collaboration, followed by Australia and the USA, the lowest.

Three model complex waste biomasses (food waste, olive mill wastewater (OMWW) and rice straw) were used to assess the effect of the aforementioned parameters. The effect of the initial pH between 4.5 and 7.0 was investigated in batch tests carried out with food waste. The highest H2 yields were shown at initial pH 4.5 (60.6 ± 9.0 mL H2/g VS) and pH 5.0 (50.7 ± 0.8 mL H2/g VS). Furthermore, tests carried out with F/M ratios of 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 at initial pH 5.0 and 6.5 revealed that a lower F/M ratio (0.5 and 1.0) favored the H2 production at an initial pH 5.0 compared to pH 6.5. Alkaline pre-treatment of raw rice straw using 4% and 8% NaOH at 55 °C for 24 h, increased the H2 yield by 26 and 57-fold, respectively. In the dark fermentation of OMWW, the H2 yield was doubled when heat-shock pre-treated activated sludge was used as inoculum in comparison to anaerobic sludge. Overall, this study shows that the application of different operating parameters to maximize the H2 yields strongly depends on the biodegradability of the substrate.","[""Bio-hydrogen"",""Dark fermentation"",""Dark fermentative hydrogen production"",""Olive mill wastewaters"",""Operational parameters"",""Substrate pre-treatments"",""Waste biomass"",""Waste valorizations"",""Bacteria"",""Biodegradation, Environmental"",""Biofuels"",""Biomass"",""Bioreactors"",""Fermentation"",""Food"",""Garbage"",""Hydrogen"",""Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"",""Solid Waste""]","[""Biofuels"",""Biohydrogen"",""Dark fermentation"",""Waste biomass"",""Waste valorization""]",10.1016/j.wasman.2016.01.044,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961778494,,0

In this context, also some interest in pumped heat electricity storage (PHES) arises. The basic principle of such a PHES system is simple; in case of oversupply of energy to the grid, a thermodynamic cycle transfers electrical energy to thermal energy and charges the storage. In the event that less electrical energy is generated than consumed, a further thermodynamic cycle discharges the storage and converts thermal energy to electrical energy back again. Against the background that combining two Carnot cycles leads always to a roundtrip efficiency of 1, the maximum possible efficiency as well as important variables of such systems are nearly unknown, so far. In this context Thess [1], assuming a maximum power cycle, and also, equal charging and discharging times, derived an analytical expression for the roundtrip efficiency as a function of the heat source and heat sink temperatures. The present work also investigates two reversible cycles with irreversible heat transfer but analyses the roundtrip efficiency as a function of storage temperature, power output, thermal resistances (R=1/(U·A)) of the heat exchangers and relative charging and discharging time. From a thermodynamic point of view, an upper limit for the roundtrip efficiency is only found if restrictions like maximum power output are specified. Rather, power output and roundtrip efficiency lead to a Pareto frontier and a selection criterion must finally base on other, probably economic aspects. Regarding an exemplary storage temperature of 400 K, a reduction of the required power output by 10 % (relative to the maximum power output) already leads to a 40% increased roundtrip efficiency and results in a much better evaluation of the theoretical potential of PHES systems.","[""Analytical expressions"",""Electricity storages"",""Finite time thermodynamics"",""Heat sink temperature"",""Renewable energy source"",""Roundtrip efficiency"",""Thermodynamic efficiency"",""Thermodynamic limits""]","[""Finite-time thermodynamics"",""Heat transfer"",""Pumped heat electricity storage"",""Thermodynamic limits""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048609986,,0

In the marine environment, the 1987 TBT ban resulted in expanded use of alternative biocides, raising the question of whether these products too have impacted the Broads ecosystem and freshwaters in general. We examined the lake sediment record in the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads for contamination by copper (Cu), an active biocide agent, and zinc (Zn), a component of booster biocides, to assess their occurrence and potential for causing environmental harm in freshwater ecosystems. After the introduction of leisure boating, there was a statistically significant difference in Cu enrichment between heavily and lightly boated sites, whereas no such difference existed prior to that time. At the heavily boated sites, the onset of Cu enrichment coincided with a period of rapid increase in leisure boating. Such enrichment has been maintained to the present day, with some evidence of continued increase. We conclude that Cu-based antifouling has measurably contaminated lakes exposed to boating, at concentrations high enough to cause ecological harm.

Global Change Biology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.How have North Sea skate and shark assemblages changed since the early 20th century when bottom trawling became widespread, whilst their environment became increasingly impacted by fishing, climate change, habitat degradation and other anthropogenic pressures? This article examines long-term changes in the distribution and occurrence of the elasmobranch assemblage of the southern North Sea, based on extensive historical time series (1902-2013) of fishery-independent survey data. In general, larger species (thornback ray, tope, spurdog) exhibited long-term declines, and the largest (common skate complex) became locally extirpated (as did angelshark). Smaller species increased (spotted and starry ray, lesser-spotted dogfish) as did smooth-hound, likely benefiting from greater resilience to fishing and/or climate change. This indicates a fundamental shift from historical dominance of larger, commercially valuable species to current prevalence of smaller, more productive species often of low commercial value. In recent years, however, some trends have reversed, with the (cold-water associated) starry ray now declining and thornback ray increasing. This shift may be attributed to (i) fishing, including mechanised beam trawling introduced in the 1960s-1970s, and historical target fisheries for elasmobranchs; (ii) climate change, currently favouring warm-water above cold-water species; and (iii) habitat loss, including potential degradation of coastal and outer estuarine nursery habitats. The same anthropogenic pressures, here documented to have impacted North Sea elasmobranchs over the past century, are likewise impacting shelf seas worldwide and may increase in the future; therefore, parallel changes in elasmobranch communities in other regions are to be expected.","[""Animals"",""Climate Change"",""Fisheries"",""North Sea"",""Oceans and Seas"",""Sharks"",""Skates (Fish)""]","[""climate change"",""community shift"",""elasmobranchs"",""fishing"",""habitat degradation"",""local extirpation"",""marine historical ecology""]",10.1111/gcb.13316,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027948644,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/gcb.13316,0

This has contributed to a widespread resistance to the establishment of a nursery of a particular configuration, such as the now-established Swedish preschool. The Swedish preschool conquest of a place in the public sphere was also a multi-year process which invited “a long and untoward way” Alva Myrdal (1982) put it. A deeply grounded notion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Swedish society of women and children as belonging to the private and home sphere and the man as belonging to the state and the public has influenced the attitude to this issue. This pattern is also well illustrated by the state of Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC) in an international context and of the ongoing debate from an EU perspective. The emergence of a preschool that combines care and education, which are of high quality and possess an extensive legitimacy, can be said to have fundamentally changed the relationship between mother-father-child.

They all fall within one of two opposite and incompatible paradigms. For the first (“old paradigm”), aging is the result of degenerative phenomena that natural selection cannot counteract completely, due to insufficient strength or opposing selective pressures. For the second (“new paradigm”), aging is favoured by natural selection in terms of supra-individual selection: it belongs to a broader category of phenomena, on the whole defined as “phenoptosis”, which are explicable only in terms of supra-individual selection. For the new paradigm, aging is a specific function that is genetically determined and regulated, with its own physiology, pathology and phylogeny. This paper describes the theoretical arguments and the empirical evidence that support or are in contrast with each of the two paradigms. Subsequently, on the basis of an imposing and authoritative amount of research, aging mechanisms at the cellular and organismal levels are described. The clear existence of such mechanisms is indispensable proof to support the new paradigm and is in complete and unsolvable contrast with the old paradigm.",,"[""Aging"",""Cancer"",""Cell senescence"",""Phenoptosis"",""Subtelomere"",""Supra-individual selection"",""Telomere""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85016329970,,0

The ""Fly Your Satellite!"" (FYS) programme of the European Space Agency (ESA), started in 2013, is an undertaking of the ESA Academy. One of its main objectives consists in transferring knowledge from space professionals to students. The university CubeSat teams selected to participate in the ""Fly Your Satellite!"" programme are supported by ESA in design, development, assembly, integration, verification and testing, and, ultimately, the launch and operation of their CubeSat. This education scheme applies and tailors ESA standards and practises usually adopted in the conduct of space programmes, enabling students to familiarise with a professional, responsible and sustainable environment. Also legal and regulatory aspects form an important part in the undertaking of a space mission, regardless of the size of a space object. Thus, the students participating in ""Fly Your Satellite!"" are guided and motivated to equally focus on non-engineering topics, such as the coordination and the registration of the satellite telecommunication frequencies, ground stations licensing, and on the registration of their spacecraft as a space object through the appropriate governmental channels. The ""Fly Your Satellite!"" programme educates the students on the need of accessing space in a responsible and sustainable way, deepening their knowledge and widening the concept of space missions, in order to raise their awareness on the fact that not only engineering and science are important, but also regulatory aspects at domestic and international level. Through lectures, information sessions, written guidelines as well as direct follow-up of the communication with government bodies, national space agencies and international institutions, university student teams are supported in the process of obtaining the appropriate authorisation for their space missions. This paper explains how the ESA Academy raises the students' awareness and knowledge on topics such as frequency coordination and registration, space object registration, third party liability and space debris mitigation, to ensure that the university space missions are undertaken in accordance with the applicable regulatory and legal frameworks.","[""Cubesat"",""Debris mitigation"",""Frequency coordination"",""Registration"",""Regulations"",""Space laws""]","[""CubeSat"",""Frequency coordination"",""International law"",""Liability"",""Registration"",""Regulations"",""Space debris mitigation guidelines"",""Space law""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051518507,,0

More specifically, we analyse the independent and interdependent effects of level of democracy and control of corruption on per capita household electricity consumption in SIDS, using data from 34 SIDS over the period 1996–2009. The results show that although the independent effects of level of democracy and control of corruption are sensitive to model specification, these two factors do have an interdependent impact on per capita household electricity consumption: democratization has positive effects on provision of electricity to the general population only when there is a certain level of corruption control in place. The results imply a) that it is important for policy actors to acknowledge the interaction between regime type and the quality of implementing institutions, and b) when planning electrification projects in SIDS, it is necessary to have information about the social and political context in order to design the most effective projects.","[""Autocracy"",""Corruption"",""Democracy"",""Household electricity consumption"",""Model specifications"",""Public good provisions"",""SIDS"",""Small island developing state""]","[""Autocracy"",""Corruption"",""Democracy"",""Electricity provision"",""Institutions"",""Public administration"",""SIDS""]",10.1016/j.enpol.2016.04.040,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971336764,,0

Accordingly, life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) methods are more and more oriented toward the development of harmonized characterization models to address impacts on ES. However, such efforts are relatively recent and have not reached full consensus yet. We investigate here on the transdisciplinary pillars related to the modeling of LCIA on ES by conducting a critical review and comparison of the state-of-the-art in both LCIA and ES domains. We observe that current LCIA practices to assess impacts on ""ES provision"" suffer from incompleteness in modeling the cause-effect chains; the multifunctionality of ecosystems is omitted; and the ""flow"" nature of ES is not considered. Furthermore, ES modeling in LCIA is limited by its static calculation framework, and the valuation of ES also experiences some limitations. The conceptualization of land use (changes) as the main impact driver on ES, and the corresponding approaches to retrieve characterization factors, eventually embody several methodological shortcomings, such as the lack of time-dependency and interrelationships between elements in the cause-effect chains.

We performed an empirical experiment in a controlled environment, where we applied two different Green Software practices to two software applications, namely query optimization in MySQL Server and usage of ""sleep"" instruction in the Apache web server. We then performed a comparison of the energy consumption at system-level and at resource-level, before and after applying the practice. Results. Our results show that both practices are effective in improving software energy efficiency, reducing consumption up to 25%. We observe that after applying the practices, resource usage is more energy-proportional i.e., increasing CPU usage increases energy consumption in an almost linear way. We also provide our reflections on empirical experimentation in software energy efficiency. Conclusions. Our contribution shows that significant improvements in software energy efficiency can be gained by applying best practices during design and development. Future work will be devoted to further validate best practices, and to improve their reusability.","[""Best practices"",""Controlled environment"",""Design and Development"",""Empirical evaluations"",""Empirical experiments"",""Query optimization"",""Software applications"",""Software practices""]","[""Best practices"",""Energy efficiency"",""Software engineering""]",10.1016/j.jss.2016.02.035,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961218303,https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1433174/green-practices-JSS.pdf,0

However, biofouling of polyamide (PA) RO membranes is a serious obstacle for a wider use of this technology. One of the promising ways of biofouling control is membranes surface modification with zwitterionic polymers. A number of published works showed that zwitterionic coatings can improve the resistance of PA membranes to the initial bacteria adhesion, however no long-term experiments with real treated water effluents were conducted. In this work a commercial PA RO membrane was surface-modified with a zwitterionic polymer and its resistance to biofouling was tested in both short-term bacteria adhesion experiments and longer filtration tests conducted using real treated wastewater effluents, spiked with a small level of nutrients. The obtained results showed that, initially, there was a clear improvement in the biofouling resistance of the modified membranes and their permeation flux remained stable, in contrast to the non-modified counterpart. However, eventually, the permeabilities of the two membranes declined to a similar degree. The results indicate that antifouling coatings might not promise a better membrane performance in long term. The analysis of the biofilms grown on the pristine and the modified membranes suggested that adaptation capabilities of biofilms overcame the favorable changes in surface properties of the membrane achieved by the modification. The presented results emphasized the importance of long-term filtration experiments as an ultimate test for assessing biofouling resistance of the modified desalination membranes.","[""Antifouling coating"",""Biofouling-resistance"",""Desalination membranes"",""Filtration experiments"",""Long-term experiments"",""Membrane performance"",""Short term"",""Zwitterionic polymers""]","[""Long-term biofouling resistance"",""Membranes biofouling"",""Short-term biofouling test"",""Zwitterionic coating""]",10.1016/j.memsci.2016.07.027,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982095556,,0

The rodent serum orthologue of human L-ficolin, ficolin-A, can bind to and opsonize Aspergillus fumigatus, the pathogen that causes invasive aspergillosis, and may participate in fungal defence. Using human monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils isolated from healthy donors, we investigated conidial association and fungal viability by flow cytometry and microscopy. Additionally, cytokine production was measured via cytometric bead arrays. Ficolin-A opsonization was observed to significantly enhance association of conidia, while also inhibiting hyphal growth and contributing to increased fungal killing following incubation with monocyte-derived macrophages and neutrophils. Additionally, ficolin-A opsonization was capable of manifesting a decrease in IL-8, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α production from MDM and IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α from neutrophils 24 h post-infection. In conclusion, rodent ficolin-A is functionally comparable to human L-ficolin and is capable of modulating the innate immune response to A. fumigatus, down-regulating cytokine production and could play an important role in airway immunity.","[""Aspergillosis"",""Aspergillus fumigatus"",""Cytokines"",""Host-Pathogen Interactions"",""Humans"",""Inflammation Mediators"",""Lectins"",""Leukocytes"",""Macrophages"",""Microbial Viability"",""Neutrophils""]","[""Aspergillosis"",""Cytokines"",""Innate immunity"",""Macrophage"",""Neutrophil""]",10.1007/s00430-015-0435-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961149433,http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/1988/3/Bidula_2015_Medical_Microbio_Immunol.pdf,0

Both conditions are associated with significant disability and patients with CD face higher mortality rates compared to the general population. The increasing understanding of the immunological basis of the disease led to the introduction of biologic therapies targeting key pathways of the natural and adaptive immune response such as Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α) inhibitors and, more recently, integrin-receptor antagonists. Treatment with TNF-α inhibitors improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes for many patients who did not benefit from conventional therapy. However, a sizeable share of patients still face suboptimal outcomes due to primary or secondary therapy failure. With the introduction of VDZ, a biologic treatment targeting novel IBD-relevant biologic pathways, it is crucial to understand how to integrate such innovations into current clinical practice. To this end, a panel of 14 Italian experts in the management of IBD met for a roundtable discussion. Recommendations concerning the management of moderate-to-severe IBD based on experts' opinions and literature review are discussed in the present report.","[""Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized"",""Biological Therapy"",""Disease Management"",""Gastrointestinal Agents"",""Humans"",""Inflammatory Bowel Diseases"",""Practice Guidelines as Topic"",""Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"",""Severity of Illness Index"",""Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha""]","[""Crohn's Disease"",""Inflammatory Bowel Disease"",""Ulcerative Colitis"",""Vedolizumab""]",10.1016/j.dld.2015.12.016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960796928,,0

Lower quality of the parent–adolescent relationship has been consistently associated with higher adolescent depressive symptoms, but discrepancies in perceptions of parents and adolescents regarding the quality of their relationship may be particularly important to consider. In the present study, we therefore examined how discrepancies in parents’ and adolescents’ perceptions of the parent–adolescent relationship were associated with early adolescent depressive symptoms, both concurrently and longitudinally over a 1-year period. Our sample consisted of 497 Dutch adolescents (57 % boys, Mage = 13.03 years), residing in the western and central regions of the Netherlands, and their mothers and fathers, who all completed several questionnaires on two occasions with a 1-year interval. Adolescents reported on depressive symptoms and all informants reported on levels of negative interaction in the parent–adolescent relationship. Results from polynomial regression analyses including interaction terms between informants’ perceptions, which have recently been proposed as more valid tests of hypotheses involving informant discrepancies than difference scores, suggested the highest adolescent depressive symptoms when both the mother and the adolescent reported high negative interaction, and when the adolescent reported high but the father reported low negative interaction. This pattern of findings underscores the need for a more sophisticated methodology such as polynomial regression analysis including tests of moderation, rather than the use of difference scores, which can adequately address both congruence and discrepancies in perceptions of adolescents and mothers/fathers of the parent–adolescent relationship in detail. Such an analysis can contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of risk factors for early adolescent depressive symptoms.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Attitude"",""Child"",""Depression"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Male"",""Models, Statistical"",""Netherlands"",""Parent-Child Relations"",""Psychology, Adolescent"",""Regression Analysis"",""Risk Factors"",""Surveys and Questionnaires""]","[""Depressive symptoms"",""Difference scores"",""Early adolescence"",""Multiple informants"",""Parent–adolescent discrepancies"",""Polynomial regression analysis""]",10.1007/s10964-016-0503-5,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982283226,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10964-016-0503-5.pdf,0

The cost-effective method of the moss-bags can be employed to evaluate both loads and chemical composition of PM. PM entrapped by the moss Pseudoscleropodium purum exposed in bags in 9 European sites was characterized for number, size and chemical composition by SEM/EDX. Moreover, moss elemental uptake of 53 elements including rare earth elements was estimated by ICP-MS analysis. All above was aimed to find possible relations between PM profile and moss uptake and to find out eventual element markers of the different land use (i.e. agricultural, urban, industrial) of the selected sites. After exposure, about 12,000 particles, mostly within the inhalable fraction, were counted on P. purum leaves; their number generally increased from the agricultural sites to the urban and industrial ones. ICP analysis indicated that twenty-three elements were significantly accumulated by mosses with different element profile according to the various land uses. The PM from agricultural sites were mainly made of natural/crustal elements or derived from rural activities. Industrial-related PM covered a wider range of sources, from those linked to specific industrial activities, to those related to manufacturing processes or use of heavy-duty vehicles. This study indicates a close association between PM amount and moss element-uptake, which increases in parallel with PM amount.

Globally, the incidence of testicular cancer is highest among men of European ancestry and lowest among men of African and Asian ancestries. Incidence rates have been increasing in many countries since at least the mid-twentieth century. Mortality rates, however, have sharply declined in developed countries. While the reason for the decline in mortality rates is well known, reasons for the increase in incidence remain poorly understood.

Non-parametric tests and ordinal logistic regression are performed to gain insight in the determinants of health care use. Results: Dutch women receive appropriate ANC more often than Belgian women. Multivariate analysis showed that lower education, unemployment, lower continuity of care and non-attendance of antenatal classes are associated with a lower likelihood of having more appropriate ANC. Conclusions: Predisposing and pregnancy related variables are most important to influence the content and timing of ANC, irrespective of the country women live in. Lower health literacy in socially vulnerable women might explain the predisposing determinants of health care use in both countries.

Methods: Participants were 1092 people with one or more chronic diseases of a nationwide prospective panel study on the consequences of chronic illness in the Netherlands. They completed the EQ-6D, a multi-dimensional questionnaire on health problems (October 2013). Chi-square tests and analyses of variance were performed to test for differences between multimorbid patients and patients with one chronic disease. To identify subgroups of multimorbid patients, cluster analysis was performed and differences in EQ-6D scores between clusters were tested with Chi-square tests. Results: Multimorbid patients (51 % of the total sample) experience more problems in most health domains than patients with one chronic disease. Almost half (44 %) of the multimorbid people had many health problems in different domains. These people were more often female, had a smaller household size, had a lower health literacy, and suffered from more chronic diseases. Remarkably, a small subgroup of multimorbid patients (4 %, mostly elderly males) is characterized by all having cognitive problems. Conclusions: Based on the problems they experience, we conclude that patients with multimorbidity have relatively many and diverse health-related needs. Extensive health-related needs among people with multimorbidity may relate not only to the number of chronic diseases they suffer from, but also to their patient characteristics.

Spatial variations in 87Sr/86Sr as a proxy for palaeomobility,"© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Strontium isotope analysis has been successfully applied to archaeological questions of residential mobility and animal husbandry for over three decades. To obtain a full understanding of variations in archaeological samples, spatial variations in bioavailable strontium should be accurately mapped or inferred. This paper presents the first archaeological bioavailable strontium map of The Netherlands. The map is compiled solely from archaeological enamel samples of rodents and selected mammals as they are considered to provide the best proxy of bioavailable Sr. The diversity of the Dutch geological subsurface is directly reflected in the spatial distribution of 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Six isoscapes are defined: A) Lower terrace of the river Meuse (0.7074-0.7091, n = 2); B) Marine and river Rhine sediments (0.7088-0.7092; n = 85); C) Holland peat area, Kempen and northern sand areas (0.7091-0.7095, n = 14); D) Rur Graben (0.7095-0.7105, n = 11); E) Push moraines (0.7095-0.7110, n = 7) and F) Northern and southern loess areas (0.7104-0.7113, n = 15). Although individual isoscapes may show some overlap, the mean of each isoscape is statistically significant different, except for zones D and E. Five other geological environments yielded no archaeological data, mainly due to poor preservation in acidic soils. To fill this data gap, additional biosphere samples will be collected and analysed. This approach, however, will require validation of the extent to which specific floral are offset compared to the average archaeological bioavailable strontium. The base map presented here now allows such a detailed assessment of potential offsets in the 87Sr/86Sr recorded by different proxies at the regional scale.",,"[""Archaeology"",""Bioavailable strontium"",""Isoscapes"",""Mobility"",""Strontium isotope"",""The Netherlands""]",10.1016/j.jasrep.2016.01.015,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84955318562,,0

In addition, the authors analyze whether compliance might be achieved by tokenism. Design/methodology/approach - The authors hand-collect pension fund and pension fund board data of the largest (by assets) 200 pension funds in the Netherlands. The authors compare descriptive statistics on board diversity, perform statistical tests on these, and perform non-linear regression techniques to investigate which pension fund characteristics influence compliance. Findings - The findings are fourfold. First, over the past three years, pension fund boards have only marginally improved on gender and age diversity. In April 2014, still more than 35 percent of the funds had no women on the board, and an overwhelming 60 percent had no members below 40 years of age. This indicates that self-regulation in the pension fund industry so far has not been effective for the industry as a whole. Second, the authors find that pension funds that have larger boards are more likely to have at least one woman on the board or at least one member below 40 years of age. Third, boards of pension funds with more assets are less likely to have young board members. Fourth, boards with at least one female have a higher probability of also having at least one member below 40 years, which is suggestive of tokenism. Research limitations/implications - Based on Hirschman's (1970) theory of voice and exit, the authors expect that pension fund boards would be more diverse than corporate boards. However, the authors find that this is not the case. Second, given the importance of generational value transfers in pension fund policy decisions, the authors expect that age is a more important diversity characteristic than gender for pension fund boards in the Netherlands. Again, the data does not support this prediction. Practical implications - Consistent with the literature on diversity in corporate boards, the authors find that diverse boards are on average larger. This suggests that, all other things equal, small boards might want to reconsider whether increasing their size would lead to more diversity and hence to more voice for participants that cannot exit the pension scheme. If larger funds hesitate to include young members because of their lack of relevant skills, then the authors would recommend setting up a platform to educate young candidates and prepare them for board membership. Forced independent auditor verification, as in the UK, might be a fruitful action the regulator could enforce on pension funds going forward. However, if that also does not lead to a significant improvement, compulsory diversity quota might be the only option left for policy makers. Originality/value - This paper contributes to the literature in at least three ways. First, the authors analyze whether self-regulation on diversity in pension fund boards has been effective. Second, the authors determine which pension fund characteristics are associated with more board diversity. Third, the authors shed light on tokenism in pension fund board composition: Diversity might be obtained through installing diversity tokens, which are individuals who have multiple diversity characteristics.",,"[""Diversification"",""Gender"",""Glass ceilings"",""Trade unions"",""Women executives""]",10.1108/EDI-05-2016-0043,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018543139,,0

Current convention selects sperm by vigour and morphology, but preliminary evidence suggests selection based on hyaluronic acid binding may be beneficial. The aim of the Hyaluronic Acid Binding Sperm Selection (HABSelect) trial is to determine the efficacy of hyaluronic acid (HA)-selection of sperm versus conventionally selected sperm prior to ICSI on live birth rate (LBR). The mechanistic aim is to assess whether and how the chromatin state of HA-selected sperm corresponds with clinical outcomes - clinical pregnancy rate (CPR), LBR and pregnancy loss (PL). Methods and analysis Couples attending UK Centres will be approached, eligibility screening performed and informed consent sought. Randomisation will occur within 24 hours prior to ICSI treatment. Participants will be randomly allocated 1:1 to the intervention arm (physiological intracytoplasmic sperm injection, PICSI) versus the control arm using conventional methods (ICSI). The primary clinical outcome is LBR ≥37 weeks' gestation with the mechanistic study determining LBR's relationship with sperm DNA integrity. Secondary outcomes will determine this for CPR and PL. Only embryologists performing the procedure will be aware of the treatment allocation. Steps will be taken to militate against biases arising from embryologists being non-blinded. Randomisation will use a minimisation algorithm to balance for key prognostic variables. The trial is powered to detect a 5% difference (24-29%: p=0.05) in LBR ≥37 weeks' gestation. Selected residual sperm samples will be tested by one or more assays of DNA integrity. Ethics and dissemination HABSelect is a UK NIHR-EME funded study (reg no 11/14/34; IRAS REF. 13/YH/0162).

Short-term consequences are mostly represented by psychological effects; in fact obese children have more chances to develop psychological or psychiatric problems than non-obese children. The main long-term effect is represented by the fact that childhood obesity continues into adulthood obesity and this results in negative effects in young adult life, since obesity increases the risk to develop morbidity and premature mortality. The obesity-related diseases are mostly represented by hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases. Medical treatment should be discouraged in childhood because of the side effects and it should be only reserved for obese children with related medical complications.

The design of sustainable manufacturing systems can be valuably supported by simulation, traditionally employed mainly for time and cost reduction. In this paper, a multi-purpose digital simulation approach is proposed to deal with sustainable manufacturing systems design through Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and 3D digital human modelling. DES models integrated with data on power consumption of the manufacturing equipment are utilized to simulate different scenarios with the aim to improve productivity as well as energy efficiency, avoiding resource and energy waste. 3D simulation based on digital human modelling is employed to assess human factors issues related to ergonomics and safety of manufacturing systems. The approach is implemented for the sustainability enhancement of a real manufacturing cell of the aerospace industry, automated by robotic deburring. Alternative scenarios are proposed and simulated, obtaining a significant improvement in terms of energy efficiency (-87%) for the new deburring cell, and a reduction of energy consumption around -69% for the coordinate measuring machine, with high potential annual energy cost savings and increased energy efficiency. Moreover, the simulation-based ergonomic assessment of human operator postures allows 25% improvement of the workcell ergonomic index. 2016 by the authors.","[""Annual energy costs"",""Digital human modelling"",""Digital simulation"",""Ergonomic assessment"",""Manufacturing equipment"",""Simulation"",""Sustainability enhancements"",""Sustainable manufacturing""]","[""3D digital human modelling"",""Discrete event simulation"",""Energy management"",""Ergonomics"",""Manufacturing systems"",""Simulation"",""Sustainable development""]",10.3390/en9100790,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84996549894,https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/10/790/pdf,0

Although there has been a great expansion of recreational vessel traffic in the Mediterranean Sea in recent decades, few studies focused on this problem. Here, Bayesian models were used to explore the influence of vessel traffic on behaviour and relative abundance patterns of bottlenose dolphin in the Archipelago de La Maddalena (Italy), a coastal area included within the Pelagos Sanctuary. Results showed that season, moon phase and presence of calves had an effect on the number of adult dolphins per sighting, and that there were differences in occurrence in the sub-areas. On the contrary, the number of vessels was negatively related to the number of adult dolphins and their mean dive intervals. In particular, when more than three recreational boats were present in the area, dolphins surfaced more frequently per unit time and behaviours such as feeding and socializing were not detected.

On this day, 124.5 mm of rain fell within 3 h (monthly mean: 29.3 mm) triggering a flash flood that inundated at least 0.4 km2 of urban settlements along the channel, affecting more than 280 buildings, 23 of a total of 53 bridges (pedestrian, vehicle and railway), and leading to the partial collapse of sections of the main road, paralyzing central parts of the city for more than one week. This study assesses the aspects of building design and site specific environmental characteristics that render a building vulnerable by considering the example of a flash flood event in February 2013. A statistical methodology is developed that enables estimation of damage probability for buildings. The applied method uses observed inundation height as a hazard proxy in areas where more detailed hydrodynamic modeling data is not available. Building design and site-specific environmental conditions determine the physical vulnerability. The mathematical approach considers both physical vulnerability and hazard related parameters and helps to reduce uncertainty in the determination of descriptive parameters, parameter interdependency and respective contributions to damage. This study aims to (1) enable the estimation of damage probability for a certain hazard intensity, and (2) obtain data to visualize variations in damage susceptibility for buildings in flood prone areas. Data collection is based on a post-flood event field survey and the analysis of high (sub-metric) spatial resolution images (Pléiades 2012, 2013). An inventory of 30 city blocks was collated in a GIS database in order to estimate the physical vulnerability of buildings. As many as 1103 buildings were surveyed along the affected drainage and 898 buildings were included in the statistical analysis. Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied to better characterize each vulnerability parameter. Multiple corresponding analyses revealed strong relationships between the “Distance to channel or bridges”, “Structural building type”, “Building footprint” and the observed damage. Logistic regression enabled quantification of the contribution of each explanatory parameter to potential damage, and determination of the significant parameters that express the damage susceptibility of a building. The model was applied 200 times on different calibration and validation data sets in order to examine performance. Results show that 90% of these tests have a success rate of more than 67%. Probabilities (at building scale) of experiencing different damage levels during a future event similar to the 8 February 2013 flash flood are the major outcomes of this study.","[""Arequipa"",""Damage probability"",""Flash flood"",""Logistic regressions"",""Vulnerability""]","[""Arequipa"",""Damage probability"",""Flash flood"",""Logistic regression"",""Risk"",""Vulnerability""]",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2015.04.017,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84943010220,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/110292/3/Ettinger_et%20al_archive%20version.pdf,0

All rights reserved.Encouraging adaptation is an essential aspect of the policy response to climate change. However, given that human activities are the main cause of environmental transformations worldwide, it follows that adaptation itself has the potential to generate further pressures, creating new threats for both local and global ecosystems. From this perspective, policies designed to encourage adaptation may conflict with regulation aimed at preserving or enhancing environmental quality. This aspect of adaptation has received relatively little consideration in either policy design or academic debate. To highlight this issue, the authors analyse the trade-offs between two fundamental ecosystem services which will be impacted by climate change: provisioning services derived from agriculture and regulating services in the form of freshwater quality. Their results indicate that climate adaptation in the farming sector will generate fundamental changes in river water quality. In some areas, policies which encourage adaptation are expected to conflict with existing regulations aimed at improving freshwater ecosystems. These findings illustrate the importance of anticipating the wider impacts of human adaptation to climate change when designing environmental policies.",,,10.4337/9781785368455.00013,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85040569999,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/52494/2/NCC_final_manuscript.pdf,0

The increasing numbers of infectious plant diseases that are caused by plant−pathogens make it ever more necessary to develop new strategies for plant disease resistance breeding. Targeted genome engineering allows the introduction of precise modifications directly into a commercial variety, offering a viable alternative to traditional breeding methods. Genome editing is a powerful tool for modifying crucial players in the plant immunity system. In this work, we propose and discuss genome-editing strategies and targets for improving resistance to phytopathogens. First of all, we present the opportunities to rewrite the effector-target sequence for avoiding effector-target molecular interaction and also to modify effector-target promoters for increasing the expression of target genes involved in the resistance process. In addition, we describe potential approaches for obtaining synthetic R-genes through genome-editing technologies (GETs). Finally, we illustrate a genome editing flowchart to modify the pathogen recognition sites and engineer an R-gene that mounts resistance to some phylogenetically divergent pathogens. GETs potentially mark the beginning of a new era, in which synthetic biology affords a basis for obtaining a reinforced plant defense system. Nowadays it is conceivable that by modulating the function of the major plant immunity players, we will be able to improve crop performance for a sustainable agriculture.",,"[""Defense system"",""Effector"",""Genome editing"",""IAC"",""IMC"",""Plant immunity"",""R-gene""]",10.3389/fpls.2016.01813,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007448560,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2016.01813/pdf,0

Survival rates today reach 95%, but EA remains a significant cause of chronic morbidity with increased risk of psychosocial problems and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQOL). No study of coping strategies of children with EA has been reported in the literature to date, but increased knowledge could lead to improved outcomes and better HRQOL. Methods: Standardized focus groups with children with EA and their parents were conducted to identify issues related to health care needs and HRQOL, with group members relating their coping experiences. Identified coping statements were content analysed using a card sorting procedure and descriptive statistics. Results: Thirty families (18 children 8–17 years; 32 parents of children with EA 2–17 years) participated in 10 focus groups. A total of 590 coping statements were recorded. Nine coping strategies were identified: problem solving (n = 116), avoidance (n = 95), recognizing responsibility (n = 71), confronting (n = 70), seeking social support (n = 63), positive reappraisal (n = 58), emotional expression (n = 46), acceptance (n = 40) and distancing (n = 31). Nine situational contexts were identified: nutritional intake (n = 227), communication of one's health condition (n = 78), self-perception when experiencing troublesome symptoms (n = 59), appearance of body or scar(s) (n = 57), physical activities like sport and play (n = 43), sleep (n = 34), hospital care (n = 33), stigmatization and social exclusion (n = 30) and medication intake (n = 29). Conclusions: Focus group methodology contributed to an increased understanding of disease-specific coping processes among children and adolescence with EA. Findings illustrate that they use several coping strategies, some of which they seem to adopt at early age and use in disease-related contexts of physical, social and emotional character. Such coping may influence health and HRQOL in children with EA. In view of the importance of establishing good coping strategies early in life, health care professionals should integrate coping aspects into care management.

Methods: Water repellency, measured by the Molarity of an Ethanol Droplet (MED) test, was quantified in 80 soil samples collected for 16 different elevations. Soil quality was assessed by measuring soil texture, pH, organic carbon, salinity, and nutrient availability. Results: SWR showed a unimodal pattern along the 2490 m transect, peaking at intermediate elevations. Unexpectedly, SWR was the highest under broad-leaf deciduous forests, and the lowest under evergreen, sclerophyllous Mediterranean vegetation types. The soil organic carbon content, and the pH were the main determinants of water repellency, showing respectively a positive, and a negative correlation with the SWR. In contrast, soil texture and salinity resulted unrelated to the SWR.

This is illustrated by a study that uncovered facilitating and hindering factors in the implementation process of a preventive strategy, proven effective in reducing the risk of long term sickness absence. To facilitate the use of biopsychological models in occupational health care, it is shown that setting up a training curriculum is possible, based on the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) grafted on available training in evidence based practice skills is possible. Furthermore, there is a need for elaboration of the personal factors relevant for workers and the relevant work-related environmental factors to support practical application of ICF in occupational health care.

As carbon emissions are easier to quantify than many other types of environmental pressure, it will be possible to reach a more definite conclusion about the likelihood of green growth than has been possible in the long-standing historical debate on growth versus the environment. We calculate the rate of decoupling between gross domestic product (GDP) and GHG emissions needed to achieve internationally agreed climate targets. Next, eight arguments are considered that together suggest that fast decoupling will be very difficult. Subsequently, we examine the main lines of research used by proponents of green growth to support their viewpoint, including theoretical arguments, exercises with integrated assessment models, and studies of the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. It will be concluded that decoupling as a main or single strategy to combine economic and environmental aims should be judged as taking a very large risk with our common future. To minimize this risk we need to seriously consider reducing our dependence on growth. This requires a fundamental change of focus in both economic research and policy. Policy relevance Currently, green growth is the only strategy of mainstream economists and policy makers to address climate change. This article demonstrates that such an exclusive focus is very risky due to the scale of the challenge and the existence of various barriers to the fast decoupling of GHG emissions from economic output.

A combined heart-cut gas chromatography (GC) with comprehensive two-dimensional GC (GC×GC) instrument was developed, specifically to increase the number of VOCs analysed using a single instrument. The system uses valve based modulation and was fully automated, making it suitable for use in the field. A laboratory comparison to an existing dual-channel GC (DC-GC) instrument demonstrated that this new GC-GC×GC can accurately measure atmospheric mixing ratios of C -C VOC species with a wide range of functionalities. Approximately hourly field measurements were conducted at a remote marine atmospheric research station in Bachok, Malaysia. This region was shown to be influenced by clean marine air masses, local anthropogenic and biogenic emission sources and aged emissions transported from highly polluted South East Asian regions.

Adult male specimens of T. carnifex were exposed daily to cadmium (44.5 nM/L and 178 nM/L as CdCl2, nominal concentrations), respectively, during 3- and 9-months; at the same time, control newts were exposed to tap water only. The accumulation of cadmium in the skin, liver and kidney, the levels of metallothioneins in the skin and the liver, the expression of metallothionein mRNA in the liver, as well as the presence of histological alterations and of apoptosis in the target organs were evaluated. The 9-months exposure induced cadmium accumulation in all the tissues examined; moreover, histological changes were observed in all the tissues examined, irrespective of the dose or the time of exposure. Apoptosis was only detected in the kidney, whereas metallothioneins and metallothionein mRNA did not increase. This study demonstrates that the existing chronic water quality criterion established for cadmium induces in the newt T. carnifex cadmium accumulation and histological alterations in the target organs examined. Together with our previous results, showing that, at these same concentrations, cadmium induced endocrine disruption, the present results suggest that the existing chronic water quality criterion for cadmium appears to be not protective of amphibians.","[""Animals"",""Apoptosis"",""Cadmium"",""Cadmium Chloride"",""Endocrine Disruptors"",""Environmental Exposure"",""Gene Expression Regulation"",""Italy"",""Kidney"",""Liver"",""Male"",""Metallothionein"",""Skin"",""Triturus"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Amphibians"",""Apoptosis"",""Cadmium"",""Environment"",""Metallothionein"",""Triturus carnifex""]",10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.01.009,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84956668602,,0

However, no longitudinal study has been conducted to examine if either the mother’s EE or the adolescent’s perception of EE predicts adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptom dimensions (an EE effect model) or vice versa (psychopathological effect model) together in one model. To unravel the reciprocal influences of maternal and adolescent perceived EE to adolescent internalizing and externalizing symptom dimensions, we tested two (i.e., one for internalizing and one for externalizing) cross-lagged panel models. In this study, it was found that both internalizing and externalizing symptom dimensions predicted the adolescent’s perception of maternal EE as well as the mother’s own rated EE criticism over time.

Used alone, they give insights into the variations of the local temperature, whereas taken together they can provide information on the climatic conditions at the point of origin of the moisture. However, recent analyses of snow from shallow pits indicate that the climatic signal can become erased in very low accumulation regions, due to local processes of snow reworking. The signal-to-noise ratio decreases and the climatic signal can then only be retrieved using stacks of several snow pits. Obviously, the signal is not completely lost at this stage, otherwise it would be impossible to extract valuable climate information from ice cores as has been done, for instance, for the last glaciation. To better understand how the climatic signal is passed from the precipitation to the snow, we present here results from varied snow samples from East Antarctica. First, we look at the relationship between isotopes and temperature from a geographical point of view, using results from three traverses across Antarctica, to see how the relationship is built up through the distillation process. We also take advantage of these measures to see how second-order parameters (d-excess and 17O-excess) are related to δ18O and how they are controlled. d-excess increases in the interior of the continent (i.e., when δ18O decreases), due to the distillation process, whereas 17O-excess decreases in remote areas, due to kinetic fractionation at low temperature. In both cases, these changes are associated with the loss of original information regarding the source. Then, we look at the same relationships in precipitation samples collected over 1 year at Dome C and Vostok, as well as in surface snow at Dome C. We note that the slope of the δ18O vs. temperature (T) relationship decreases in these samples compared to those from the traverses, and thus caution is advocated when using spatial slopes for past climate reconstruction. The second-order parameters behave in the same way in the precipitation as in the surface snow from traverses, indicating that similar processes are active and that their interpretation in terms of source climatic parameters is strongly complicated by local temperature effects in East Antarctica. Finally we check if the same relationships between δ18O and second-order parameters are also found in the snow from four snow pits. While the d-excess remains opposed to δ18O in most snow pits, the 17O-excess is no longer positively correlated to δ18O and even shows anti-correlation to δ18O at Vostok. This may be due to a stratospheric influence at this site and/or to post-deposition processes.",,,10.5194/tc-10-837-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964870715,https://www.the-cryosphere.net/10/837/2016/tc-10-837-2016.pdf,0

However, the genetic characteristics of the transmitted viruses that are preferentially selected have not been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed amino acids changes in the envelope protein during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV deep transmission history and current HIV evolution within the last 15–20 years. Our results confirmed that the V1V2 region of gp120 protein, particularly V1, was preferentially selected. A shorter V1 region was preferred during transmission history, while during epidemic, HIV may evolve to an expanded V1 region gradually and thus escape immune recognition. We then constructed different HIV-1 V1 mutants using different HIV-1 subtypes to elucidate the role of the V1 region in envelope function. We found that the V1 region, although highly variable, was indispensable for virus entry and infection, probably because V1 deletion mutants exhibited impaired processing of gp160 into mature gp120 and gp41. Additionally, the V1 region affected Env incorporation. These results indicated that the V1 region played a critical role in HIV transmission and infection.

Previous research from Anglo-Saxon countries implies that the social, political and economical interests of the voluntarily childless are in conflict with the interests of parents and that state subsidies and policies in support of parents could be considered as discrimination of childless people. However, in contrast to this previous research, the interviewees did not object to the redistributive tax system that benefits parents or to the political ambition to build a “child-friendly” labour market where it is possible to reconcile work with parenthood. Instead they defended themselves against accusations for being “free-riders” who did not contribute to society by referring to the responsibility they took by paying high taxes. Notwithstanding, the informants criticized how some parents misused their benefits and cashed in on them, making the voluntarily childless feel exploited. The article also suggests that state subsidies can eliminate some motives for voluntary childlessness but not all of them. The results add nuances to previous research as they highlight the importance of further investigating the relations between parents and non-parents in a social and political context.",,"[""Parenthood bonus"",""Redistributive tax system"",""Social policies"",""Sweden"",""Voluntary childlessness"",""Workplace policies""]",10.1007/s10834-015-9474-z,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946962769,,0

Methods: An experimental between-subjects and within-subjects design with manipulations of CPI presentation formats. We enrolled both consumers with lower socioeconomic status (SES)/cognitive skills and consumers with higher SES/cognitive skills, recruited through an online access panel. Respondents received fictitious CPI and completed questions about interpretation and information use. Between subjects, we tested (1) displaying an overall performance score (yes/no); (2) displaying a small number of quality indicators (5 vs 9); and (3) displaying different types of evaluative symbols (star ratings, coloured dots and word icons vs numbers and bar graphs). Within subjects, we tested the effect of a reduced number of healthcare providers (5 vs 20). Data were analysed using descriptive analysis, analyses of variance and paired-sampled t tests. Results: A total of 902 (43%) respondents participated. Displaying an overall performance score and the use of coloured dots and word icons particularly enhanced consumer understanding. Importantly, respondents provided with coloured dots most often correctly selected the top three healthcare providers (84.3%), compared with word icons (76.6% correct), star ratings (70.6% correct), numbers (62.0%) and bars (54.2%) when viewing performance scores of 20 providers. Furthermore, a reduced number of healthcare providers appeared to support consumers, for example, when provided with 20 providers, 69.5% correctly selected the top three, compared with 80.2% with five providers. Discussion: Particular presentation formats enhanced consumer understanding of CPI, most importantly the use of overall performance scores, word icons and coloured dots, and a reduced number of providers displayed.

Methods and Findings: Studies were identified from 15 databases (including MEDLINE and Embase) and by handsearching, reference checking, internet searches, and contacting experts. The last database searches were conducted in July 2016. There were 28 methodological evaluations that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 9 studies compared the proportion of trials reporting adverse events by publication status. The median percentage of published documents with adverse events information was 46% compared to 95% in the corresponding unpublished documents. There was a similar pattern with unmatched studies, for which 43% of published studies contained adverse events information compared to 83% of unpublished studies. A total of 11 studies compared the numbers of adverse events in matched published and unpublished documents. The percentage of adverse events that would have been missed had each analysis relied only on the published versions varied between 43% and 100%, with a median of 64%. Within these 11 studies, 24 comparisons of named adverse events such as death, suicide, or respiratory adverse events were undertaken. In 18 of the 24 comparisons, the number of named adverse events was higher in unpublished than published documents. Additionally, 2 other studies demonstrated that there are substantially more types of adverse events reported in matched unpublished than published documents. There were 20 meta-analyses that reported the odds ratios (ORs) and/or risk ratios (RRs) for adverse events with and without unpublished data. Inclusion of unpublished data increased the precision of the pooled estimates (narrower 95% confidence intervals) in 15 of the 20 pooled analyses, but did not markedly change the direction or statistical significance of the risk in most cases. The main limitations of this review are that the included case examples represent only a small number amongst thousands of meta-analyses of harms and that the included studies may suffer from publication bias, whereby substantial differences between published and unpublished data are more likely to be published. Conclusions: There is strong evidence that much of the information on adverse events remains unpublished and that the number and range of adverse events is higher in unpublished than in published versions of the same study. The inclusion of unpublished data can also reduce the imprecision of pooled effect estimates during meta-analysis of adverse events.","[""Clinical Trials as Topic"",""Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"",""Humans"",""Meta-Analysis as Topic"",""Publication Bias"",""Review Literature as Topic"",""Risk Assessment""]",,10.1371/journal.pmed.1002127,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989902038,https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002127&type=printable,0

We aimed to compare clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction caused by Chagas' disease, with other etiologies, in the era of modern HF therapies. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study included 2552 Latin American patients randomized in the PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With ACEI to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) and ATMOSPHERE (Aliskiren Trial to Minimize Outcomes in Patients With Heart Failure) trials. The investigator-reported etiology was categorized as Chagasic, other nonischemic, or ischemic cardiomyopathy. The outcomes of interest included the composite of cardiovascular death or HF hospitalization and its components and death from any cause. Unadjusted and adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were performed to compare outcomes by pathogenesis. There were 195 patients with Chagasic HF with reduced ejection fraction, 1300 with other nonischemic cardiomyopathy, and 1057 with ischemic cardiomyopathy. Compared with other etiologies, Chagasic patients were more often female, younger, and had lower prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and renal impairment (but had higher prevalence of stroke and pacemaker implantation) and had worse health-related quality of life. The rates of the composite outcome were 17.2, 12.5, and 11.4 per 100 person-years for Chagasic, other nonischemic, and ischemic patients, respectively-adjusted hazard ratio for Chagasic versus other nonischemic: 1.49 (95% confidence interval, 1.15-1.94; P=0.003) and Chagasic versus ischemic: 1.55 (1.18-2.04; P=0.002). The rates of allcause mortality were also higher.

Mexico has been at the forefront of PES implementation since 2003, and the country has now more than 2.6 million hectares under a variety of PES contracts. In this article, we perform a choice experiment with a group of 82 community forest owners who are receiving a payment for providing biodiversity-related ecosystem services in the state of Chiapas. Considering possible future evolutions in contract design, we explore individuals preferences over contract characteristics including who is involved in deciding the parcels to be included in the contract, the type of technical intermediary, the level of payment and the type of incentive (either in individual cash payments or in collective investments). Our results show a reluctance to decide collectively on issues related to forest conservation, as well as on dedicating a share of payments to collective projects. We find strong individual preferences for payments in cash, even when the amount of monetary compensation is lower than in the existing PES contract, and we show that most participants value positively the help received by external service providers in PES implementation. An analysis of preference heterogeneity suggests that community leaders play a key role in moderating individual preferences and enhancing participation structured around working groups. We thus argue that the willingness to accept a PES program is greatly dependent on local governance factors. As such, exploring ways for PES contractual options to match the diversity of local conditions and individual preferences – allowing a modular allocation of PES into cash or investment on an individual or collective basis- could further stimulate participation in Mexico's PES programme.",,"[""Benefit-sharing"",""Choice experiment"",""Collective contracts"",""Ecosystem services"",""Mexico"",""Payments""]",10.1016/j.landusepol.2016.07.023,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982937983,,0

Multiple linear mixed models indicate that experimental years had stronger influence on biomass than warming scenarios and species diversity. Species diversity and biomass had almost humpback relationships under different warming scenarios over different experimental years. There was generally a negative diversity–biomass relationship, implying that a positive diversity–biomass relationship was not the case. The application of different warming scenarios did not change this tendency. The change in community resistance to all warming scenarios was generally negatively correlated with increasing species diversity, the strength of the correlation varying both between treatments and between years within treatments. The strong effect of experimental years was consistent with the notion that niche complementarity effects increase over time, and hence, higher biomass productivity over experimental years. The strongest negative relationship was found in the first year of the pulse treatment, indicating that the community had weak resistance to an extreme event of one season of abnormally warm climate. Biomass production started recovering during the two subsequent years. Contrasting biomass-related resistance emerged in the different treatments, indicating that micro sites within the same plant community may differ in their resistance to different warming scenarios.",,"[""Biomass"",""Climate variability"",""Community resistance"",""Extreme climatic events"",""Species diversity""]",10.1007/s11284-016-1403-6,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990831312,,0

However, bacterial diseases still represent a worldwide treat. The ability of microorganisms to develop resistance, together with the indiscriminate use of antibiotics, is mainly responsible for this situation; thus, resistance has compelled the scientific community to search for novel therapeutics. In this scenario, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) provide a promising strategy against a wide array of pathogenic microorganisms, being able to act directly as antimicrobial agents but also being important regulators of the innate immune system. This review is an attempt to explore marine AMPs as a rich source of molecules with antimicrobial activity. In fact, the sea is poorly explored in terms of AMPs, but it represents a resource with plentiful antibacterial agents performing their role in a harsh environment. For the application of AMPs in the medical field limitations correlated to their peptide nature, their inactivation by environmental pH, presence of salts, proteases, or other components have to be solved. Thus, these peptides may act as templates for the design of more potent and less toxic compounds.","[""Animals"",""Anti-Infective Agents"",""Antimicrobial Cationic Peptides"",""Aquatic Organisms"",""Bacteria"",""Drug Resistance, Bacterial"",""Humans"",""Protein Structure, Secondary""]","[""Antimicrobial peptide"",""Marine AMPs"",""Membrane bilayer"",""Microbial resistance""]",10.3390/ijms17050785,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982111745,https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/17/5/785/pdf,0

It may exhibit the potential for patients under dabigatran therapy suffering ischemic stroke to regain eligibility for thrombolysis with rt-PA and may inhibit lesion growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage on dabigatran. Aims: To provide insights into the clinical use of idarucizumab in patients under effective dabigatran anticoagulation presenting with signs of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage. Methods: Retrospective data collected from German neurological/neurosurgical departments administering idarucizumab following product launch from January to August 2016 were used. Results: Thirty-one patients presenting with signs of stroke received idarucizumab in 22 stroke centers. Nineteen patients treated with dabigatran presented with ischemic stroke and 12 patients suffered from intracranial bleeding. In patients receiving rt-PA thrombolysis following idarucizumab, 79% benefitted from i.v. thrombolysis with a median improvement of five points in NIHSS. No bleeding complications occurred. Hematoma growth was observed in 2 out of 12 patients with intracranial hemorrhage. The outcome was favorable with a median NIHSS improvement of 5.5 points and mRS 0–3 in 67%. Overall, mortality was low with 6.5% (one patient in each group). Conclusion: Administration of rt-PA after reversing dabigatran activity with idarucizumab in case of ischemic stroke is feasible, easy to manage, effective, and appears to be safe. In dabigatran-associated intracranial hemorrhage, idarucizumab has the potential to prevent hematoma growth and improve outcome.

In addition, we explored whether the effect of attentional focus on motor learning was influenced by children's age and verbal working memory capacity. Novice 8–9-year old children (n = 30) and 11–12-year-old children (n = 30) practiced a golf putting task. For each age group, half the participants received instructions to focus (internally) on the swing of their arm, while the other half was instructed to focus (externally) on the swing of the club. Children's verbal working memory capacity was assessed with the Automated Working Memory Assessment. Consistent with many reports on adult's motor learning, children in the external groups demonstrated greater improvements in putting accuracy than children who practiced with an internal focus. This effect was similar across age groups. Verbal working memory capacity was not found to be predictive of motor learning, neither for children in the internal focus groups nor for children in the external focus groups. In conclusion, primary school children's motor learning is enhanced by external focus instructions compared to internal focus instructions. The purported modulatory roles of children's working memory, attentional capacity, or focus preferences require further investigation.","[""Aging"",""Attention"",""Child"",""Female"",""Golf"",""Humans"",""Learning"",""Male"",""Memory, Short-Term"",""Motor Skills"",""Physical Education and Training""]","[""children"",""constrained action hypothesis"",""external focus of attention"",""motor learning"",""working memory""]",10.1080/00222895.2016.1152224,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976260312,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00222895.2016.1152224?needAccess=true,0

Sequences for several nuclear regions were screened but none showed significant variation within WCC. This result favours a single secondary species hypothesis and indicates the existence of a mito-nuclear discordance in WCC. Therefore, mtDNA groups were considered only as genetic units that carry information about ancient divergences within WCC and not as taxonomic units. The reconstruction of ancestral ranges and divergence time estimates were used to link the current genetic structure with paleogeographic processes. These results showed that the emergence of mtDNA groups in WCC could be related to the Messinian Salinity Crisis, the climate cooling during the Pliocene and Pleistocene, and (paleo)shifting of the Adriatic Sea coastline in the Padanovenezian Plain. The most recent common ancestor of the mtDNA groups most likely originated from Dalmatia (eastern Adriatic coast) as indicated by the reconstruction of ancestral ranges.

Visual field defects and hypopituitarism, both related to mass effect, remain the leading symptoms, although these masses can be completely asymptomatic (pituitary incidentalomas) or eventually disclosed upon occurrence of apoplexy (10 %). Nevertheless, because ageing is related to several endocrinological and metabolic changes, including significant modification of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal functions, clinical features of the eventual pituitary disorder may be misdiagnosed. The rates of prevalence for macroadenomas in elderly are higher as compared to the other age groups, but these tumours do not present inner increased invasiveness, probably due to the lower cell proliferation rate identified. The surgical management of pituitary adenomas in the elderly is somehow burdened by the presence of mild and/or severe systemic co-morbidities (specially cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological disorders) found in more than 50 % of patients; this aspect dramatically increases anaesthesiological risk and significantly the mortality rate between young and elderly patients.

We hypothesize that this is because stream communities are largely determined by environmental properties at a larger-than-local spatial scale. Using benthic invertebrate community data as well as hydromorphological habitat quality data from 1087 stream sites, we investigated the role of local- (i.e. 100 m reach) and regional-scale (i.e. 5 km ring centered on each reach) stream hydromorphological habitat quality (LQ and RQ, respectively) on benthic invertebrate communities. The analyses showed that RQ had a greater individual effect on communities than LQ, but the effects of RQ and LQ interacted. Where RQ was either good or poor, communities were exclusively determined by RQ. Only in areas of intermediate RQ, LQ determined communities. Metacommunity analysis helped to explain these findings. Species pools in poor RQ areas were most depauperated, resulting in insufficient propagule pressure for species establishment even at high LQ (e.g. restored) sites. Conversely, higher alpha diversity and an indication of lower beta dispersion signals at mass effects occurring in high RQ areas. That is, abundant neighboring populations may help to maintain populations even at sites with low LQ. The strongest segregation in species co-occurrence was detected at intermediate RQ levels, suggesting that communities are structured to the highest degree by a habitat/environmental gradient. From these results, we conclude that when restoring riverine habitats at the reach scale, restoration projects situated in intermediate RQ settings will likely be the most successful in enhancing the naturalness of local communities. With a careful choice of sites for reach-scale restoration in settings of intermediate RQ and a strategy that aims to expand areas of high RQ, the success of reach-scale restoration in promoting the ecological quality of communities can be greatly improved.","[""Co-occurrence"",""Ecological quality"",""European Water Framework Directive"",""Macroinvertebrates"",""Mass effects"",""Meta communities"",""Source-sink"",""Stream habitats"",""Animals"",""Aquatic Organisms"",""Conservation of Natural Resources"",""Ecology"",""Ecosystem"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Environmental Restoration and Remediation"",""Invertebrates"",""Rivers""]","[""Ecological quality class"",""European Water Framework Directive"",""Macroinvertebrate"",""Mass effect"",""Metacommunity"",""Source-sink-dynamics"",""Species co-occurrence"",""Stream habitat quality""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.126,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959421942,,0

An in situ microscope (ISM) is immersed directly into samples of activated sludge with Microthrix parvicella as dominating species. Without needing further preparatory steps, the automatic evaluation of the ISM-images generates two signals: the number of individual filaments per image (ISM-filament counting) and the total extended filament length (TEFL) per image (ISM-online TEFL). In this first version of the image-processing algorithm, closely spaced crossing filament-segments or filaments within bulk material are not detected. The signals show highly linear correlation both with the standard filament index and the TEFL. Correlations were further substantiated by comparison with real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR) measurements of M. parvicella and of the diluted sludge volume index. In this case study, in situ microscopy proved to be a suitable tool for straightforward online-monitoring of filamentous bacteria in activated sludge systems.

This article aims to examine why citizens support or reject climate policies. For this purpose, we provide a cross-disciplinary overview of empirical and experimental research on public attitudes and preferences that has emerged in the last few years. The various factors influencing policy support are divided into three general categories: (1) social-psychological factors and climate change perception, such as the positive influences of left-wing political orientation, egalitarian worldviews, environmental and self-transcendent values, climate change knowledge, risk perception, or emotions like interest and hope; (2) the perception of climate policy and its design, which includes, among others, the preference of pull over push measures, the positive role of perceived policy effectiveness, the level of policy costs, as well as the positive effect of perceived policy fairness and the recycling of potential policy revenues; (3) contextual factors, such as the positive influence of social trust, norms and participation, wider economic, political and geographical aspects, or the different effects of specific media events and communications. Finally, we discuss the findings and provide suggestions for future research. Policy relevance Public opinion is a significant determinant of policy change in democratic countries. Policy makers may be reluctant to implement climate policies if they expect public opposition. This article seeks to provide a better understanding of the various factors influencing public responses to climate policy proposals. Most of the studied factors include perceptions about climate change, policy and its attributes, all of which are amenable to intervention. The acquired insights can thus assist in improving policy design and communication with the overarching objective to garner more public support for effective climate policy.",,"[""climate policy"",""policy acceptance"",""policy support"",""public attitudes"",""public opinion"",""public preferences""]",10.1080/14693062.2015.1058240,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84933575492,,0

Anaerobic digestion (AD) of waste-activated sludge (WAS) is a widely accepted method for sludge stabilization and biogas production. The enhancement of the AD process has been studied by implementing different pretreatments of WAS, codigestion of WAS, and other substrates and applying multiphase systems. The current study applied compost material from aerobic composting of plant litter as inoculants to the WAS digesters. The studies were carried out in two phases. First, compost with different maturations was tested. During the process of compost production, the temperature and the microbial community evolve with time. The phases of composting are indicated by temperature difference. In this test, the compost was sampled at its initial, hot and stable phases, respectively. The stable compost was found to have the strongest stimulatory effect on the biogas production. The reactor with an inoculation of 0.1 g compost DW/g COD could achieve 42% more biogas production than the control reactor at the 10th day. Subsequent experiments further investigated this effect by distinguishing it into biological and nonbiological aspects. After 60 days, the biological aspects showed a stronger stimulatory effect of biogas production and a better removal of effluent chemical oxygen demand (COD) than the control. Furthermore, an addition of 0.1 g compost DW/g COD, with a thermo-alkaline pretreatment and kitchen waste as co-substrate, would give 19% more specific biogas production (mL biogas/g COD loaded) than the control.","[""Activated sludge"",""Activated sludge systems"",""Codigestion"",""Nutrient removal"",""Reactor"",""Specific biogas productions"",""Temperature differences"",""Waste activated sludges""]","[""Activated sludge"",""Anaerobic digestion"",""Biogas"",""Codigestion"",""Composting"",""Nutrient removal"",""Reactor""]",10.1201/9781315366364,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058606124,,0

The recent positive results obtained with immunotherapy and with the combination of angiogenesis inhibitors and docetaxel, changed the therapeutic scenario of the second line therapy of non squamous NSCLC without actionable mutations.

GLP-1 agonists are in clinical use for treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. GLP-1, however, may also affect brain areas associated with emotionality regulation. Here we aimed to characterize acute and chronic impact of GLP-1 on anxiety and depression-like behavior. Rats were subjected to anxiety and depression behavior tests following acute or chronic intracerebroventricular or intra-dorsal raphe (DR) application of GLP-1 receptor agonists. Serotonin or serotonin-related genes were also measured in the amygdala, DR and the hippocampus. We demonstrate that both GLP-1 and its long lasting analog, Exendin-4, induce anxiety-like behavior in three rodent tests of this behavior: black and white box, elevated plus maze and open field test when acutely administered intraperitoneally, into the lateral ventricle, or directly into the DR. Acute central GLP-1 receptor stimulation also altered serotonin signaling in the amygdala. In contrast, chronic central administration of Exendin-did not alter anxiety-like behavior but significantly reduced depression-like behavior in the forced swim test. Importantly, this positive effect of Exendin-was not due to significant body weight loss and reduced food intake, since rats pair-fed to Exendin-rats did not show altered mood. Collectively we show a striking impact of central GLP-1 on emotionality and the amygdala serotonin signaling that is divergent under acute versus chronic GLP-1 activation conditions. We also find a novel role for the DR GLP-1 receptors in regulation of behavior. These results may have direct relevance to the clinic, and indicate that Exendin-may be especially useful for obese patients manifesting with comorbid depression.","[""Animals"",""Anti-Anxiety Agents"",""Antidepressive Agents"",""Anxiety"",""Body Weight"",""Brain"",""Emotions"",""Feeding Behavior"",""Glucagon-Like Peptide 1"",""Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor"",""Male"",""Obesity"",""Peptides"",""Rats"",""Rats, Sprague-Dawley"",""Serotonin"",""Venoms""]","[""Anxiety"",""Depression"",""Exendin-4"",""Food intake"",""GLP-1"",""Obesity""]",10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.11.021,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958175636,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2015.11.021,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Public Health Association. All rights reserved.Background: The Nordic welfare system has been acknowledged as favourable for children, successfully contributing to low child mortality and poverty rates. Nevertheless, mental health problems among children and adolescents are common and the economic situation of the family has been highlighted as an important determinant. In spite of similar social, political and cultural structures, the Nordic countries differ; Iceland was most affected by the global financial crisis in 2008. The aim of this study was to examine potential differences in parental financial stress and the associations to child mental health between the Nordic countries as well as age and gender differences. Methods: The study sample consisted of 6330 children aged 4-16 years old included in the 2011 version of the Nordic Study of Children's Health, Wellbeing and Quality of life. The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was used to measure mental health problems. Results: In Iceland, 47.7% of the parents reported financial stress while ≤20% did so in the other countries except for Finland (33.5%). However, in case of parental financial stress the OR of mental health problems comparing children to parents with and without financial stress was significantly lower among the Icelandic children (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.15-2.24) than among the others: Denmark OR 3.07 (95% CI 2.15-4.39), Finland OR 2.28 (95% CI 1.60-3.25), Norway OR 2.77 (95% CI 1.86-4.12), Sweden OR 3.31(95% CI 2.26-4.86). No significant age or gender differences in the ORs were observed.

IROs are specialist social workers whose function is to review the cases of children in public care and ensure that they have appropriate plans and that these plans are being implemented in a timely manner. IROs are ‘independent’ in the sense that they are not the social worker to whom a child's case is allocated, and do not have line management responsibility for the case, however they are employed by the same local authority. There are detailed regulations and government guidelines on their role, and high expectations, but what does independence mean in this context? The paper draws on a mixed methods study conducted by the authors in 2012–14, which included a survey of 122 files of children in care from four local authorities; interviews with 54 social workers, 54 IROs, 15 parents, and 15 young people; six focus groups; and nationally-distributed questionnaires for IROs (65), social work managers (46) and children's guardians (39). The study found five dimensions of independence: professional, operational, perceived, institutional and effective. The IROs and social workers generally took more nuanced and pragmatic approaches to their inter-professional working than prescribed in the policy guidance or the pronouncements of politicians and judges, seeing this as more likely to be effective. IROs are not, and cannot be, the solution to all the problems that exist in services for children in care, and the other professionals involved should not be seen as necessarily any less capable or committed to the best interests of the children. Rather, the IRO is part of an interactive system of checks and balances which, together, may increase the likelihood that professional judgement will be exercised effectively on the child's behalf.",,"[""Children in care"",""Independent Reviewing Officers"",""Managerialism"",""Professional effectiveness"",""Professional independence""]",10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.11.003,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994474531,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.11.003,0

Knowledge of where compressible sediments are located and how thick these are is essential for estimating subsidence risk. A probabilistic method for coupled bedrock-level and soil-layer modeling to detect compressible sediments is presented. The method is applied in an area in central Stockholm, where clay is the compressible sediment layer. First, a bedrock-level model was constructed from three sources of information: (a) geotechnical drillings reaching the bedrock; (b) drillings not reaching the bedrock; and (c) mapped bedrock outcrops. Input data for the probabilistic bedrock-level model was generated by a stepwise Kriging procedure. Second, a three layer soil model was constructed, including the following materials: (a) coarse grained post glacial and filling material below the ground surface; (b) glacial and post-glacial clays; and (c) coarse grained glaciofluvial and glacial till deposits above the bedrock. Layer thicknesses were transformed to proportions of the total soil thickness. Since Kriging requires data to be normally distributed, the proportions were transformed from proportions (P) to standard normal quantiles (z). In each iteration of a Monte-Carlo simulation, a spatial distribution of the bedrock level was simulated together with the transformed values for the soil-layer proportions. From the iterations, the probability density of the clay thickness (compressible sediments) at each grid cell was calculated. The results of the case study map the expected value (mean) and the 95th percentile of the probability of compressible sediments at specific locations. The resulting model is geologically realistic and validated through a cross-validation procedure in order to be in good agreement with a reference dataset. The case study showed that the method can efficiently handle large amounts of data and requires little manual adjustment. Moreover, the mapped results can provide useful decision support when planning risk-reducing measures and when communicating with stakeholders. Although this novel method is developed for risk assessment of groundwater drawdown induced subsidence, it is useful for other applications involving spatial soil strata modeling.","[""Decision supports"",""Groundwater drawdown"",""Large amounts of data"",""Level model"",""Probabilistic approaches"",""Probabilistic methods"",""Probability densities"",""Sources of informations""]","[""Decision support"",""Groundwater drawdown induced subsidence"",""Probabilistic bedrock level model"",""Probabilistic soil strata model"",""Risk assessment""]",10.1016/j.enggeo.2015.11.006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959109571,https://research.chalmers.se/publication/226687/file/226687_Fulltext.pdf,0

Up to 23 nanomedicines have been approved, and approximately 50 are in clinical development. Meanwhile, the first nanosimilars have entered the market through the generic approval pathway, but clinical differences have been observed. Many healthcare professionals may be unaware of this issue and must be informed of these clinically relevant variances. This article provides a tool for rational decision making for the inclusion of nanomedicines into the hospital formulary, including defined criteria for evaluation of substitutability or interchangeability. The tool was generated by conducting a roundtable with an international panel of experts and follows the same thought process that was developed and published earlier for the selection of biologicals/biosimilars. In addition to the existing criteria for biosimilars, a set of seven criteria was identified that specifically apply to nanosimilars. These include (1) particle size and size distribution, (2) particle surface characteristics, (3) fraction of uncaptured bioactive moiety, (4) stability on storage, (5) bioactive moiety uptake and (6) distribution, and (7) stability for ready-to-use preparation.

Despite the well documented disease burden, the economic burden of physical inactivity remains unquantified at the global level. A better understanding of the economic burden could help to inform resource prioritisation and motivate efforts to increase levels of physical activity worldwide. Methods Direct health-care costs, productivity losses, and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) attributable to physical inactivity were estimated with standardised methods and the best data available for 142 countries, representing 93·2% of the world's population. Direct health-care costs and DALYs were estimated for coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and colon cancer attributable to physical inactivity. Productivity losses were estimated with a friction cost approach for physical inactivity related mortality. Analyses were based on national physical inactivity prevalence from available countries, and adjusted population attributable fractions (PAFs) associated with physical inactivity for each disease outcome and all-cause mortality. Findings Conservatively estimated, physical inactivity cost health-care systems international $ (INT$) 53·8 billion worldwide in 2013, of which $31·2 billion was paid by the public sector, $12·9 billion by the private sector, and $9·7 billion by households. In addition, physical inactivity related deaths contribute to $13·7 billion in productivity losses, and physical inactivity was responsible for 13·4 million DALYs worldwide. High-income countries bear a larger proportion of economic burden (80·8% of health-care costs and 60·4% of indirect costs), whereas low-income and middle-income countries have a larger proportion of the disease burden (75·0% of DALYs). Sensitivity analyses based on less conservative assumptions led to much higher estimates. Interpretation In addition to morbidity and premature mortality, physical inactivity is responsible for a substantial economic burden.

All rights reserved.Psychological disorders can be understood as disorders of affective regulation. Perturbations in affective regulation are not only characterized by specific forms of a patient’s subjective experiences of emotions, but are also observable as typical relationship offers characterized by specific verbal and nonverbal behavior. Therefore, patients with anorexia nervosa have been studied in terms of whether specific interactive relationship patterns could be observed. In our paper, we will first outline our research approach that focuses on the micro-analytic study of nonverbal interactive behavior and, in particular, the facial expressions of emotions. The interactions were videotaped and selected sequences were coded with the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). These objectively coded data were then linked to intrapsychic and interactive processes of affective regulation. Using this approach, three different types of dyads have been analyzed. In the first study, interviews with anorexic patients about anger and joy situations were examined. In comparison to a healthy control group, anorexic patients showed nonverbal behaviors, such as reduction of eye contact and simultaneous smiling, that reduce the affective relatedness between persons. The patients also displayed less felt smiles and more masking smiles. In the second study, dyadic interactions between mothers and their adolescent anorexic daughters were investigated. The mothers’ interactive behavior was characterized by very frequent relationship offers such as smiling. The daughters, however, reacted to these relationship offers with strategies of rejection. They averted their gaze, closed their eyes and did not at all respond to their mothers’ intense smiling. There was also a reduction in listener responses such as “mhms” or head nodding. A third study investigated the interactive regulation of guilt feelings between female anorexic patients and their mothers compared to healthy daughters and their mothers. While processes of guilt feeling induction in healthy dyads were mostly initiated by the mothers, in the clinical dyads, guilt feelings were mostly induced by the daughters. Anorexic patients interactively rejected their mothers’ frequent relationship offers and their attempts to regulate inner conflictive feelings. By not relieving the mothers’ guilt feelings, the anorexic daughters remained in the more powerful position and were able to control the situation and retain a certain level of autonomy. We assume that these typical interactive relationship patterns also occur in the therapeutic relationship and manifest themselves in typical processes of transference and counter-transference. Thus, these patterns may become addressed and subsequently changed in the course of psychotherapy.",,"[""Anorexia nervosa"",""Facial expression"",""Facs"",""Interaction studies"",""Interactive relationship patterns"",""Microsequence analysis"",""Nonverbal behavior""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034245410,,0

For this purpose, we provide a well constrained short-lived radionuclides continuous age-depth relationship of the sediment sequence (mean accumulation rate of 5.18 ± 0.28 mm·yr-1) with Hg accumulation rates (Hg AR), Hg isotopic composition and extensive historical data. Hg AR were stable around 45 μg·m-2·y-1 from 1860 to WWI and rose to reach their maximum at the end of WWII (250 μg m-2 y-1) followed by a gradual decreased to reach about 90 μg m-2 y-1 in the current period. Normalization to a terrigenous Hg proxy highlighted the dominance of atmospheric Hg inputs to the lake. The combination of Hg AR with isotopic signatures through the use of binary mixing (δ199Hg vs 1/Hg AR) models and isotopic plots (and comparison to literature data) allowed us to identify the main industrial and urban historical inputs. The major outcome of this study is that the Hg mass independent fractionation (MIF) signature did not enable the identification of particular anthropogenic sources but reflected an integrated pool of industrial and urban emissions which tend to shift to less negative MIF values (mean: -0.15 ± 0.04‰) during their period of maximum emissions. Temporal MIF and Hg AR variations depict the rising Hg emissions from the industrial revolution (1860-1910) to the modern industrial and urban development period (1950-1980). Mass dependent fractionation (MDF) signatures enabled the identification of major contributors in relation to their relative intensities lying between two endmember pools: (i) the combustion activities (smelters, cement factories and urban heating) with more negative δ202Hg values, and (ii) the chemical and electrometallurgical activities (electrochemistry, chlor-alkali) with higher δ202Hg values. Unconformities of MIF and MDF signatures were observed during WWI, WWII and interwar period, and were attributed to drastic and rapid changes in regional industrial activities. Finally, recent laws regarding Hg emissions (1998-2011) prove their efficiency as Hg AR decreased with a return to more negative MIF and MDF signatures such as during the industrial revolution period. Our study highlights that the combination of Hg isotopic data with Hg AR in sediment archives is a useful tool for reconstructing the history of anthropogenic Hg emissions, and has the potential to identifiy their relative contributions.","[""Anthropogenic sources"",""Industrial activities"",""Industrial revolutions"",""Lake sediments"",""Mass-independent fractionation"",""Relative contribution"",""Short-lived radionuclides"",""Urban areas""]","[""Industry"",""Isotopes"",""Lake sediment"",""Mercury"",""Urban area""]",10.1016/j.chemgeo.2016.03.016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962128654,,0

The fountain also showed a significant effect which was however smaller than for vegetation. The varying noise level of the flyovers also had aneffect on both indices, but effects were smaller just as for the fountain. Main effects for eventfulness were the level ofurbanity (the difference between residential and commercial), vegetation and water features (effect size in this order). Also, water features and vegetation had a significant and profound effect on the visual appraisal, whereas urbanity showedno significant effect.The preliminary results therefore point to for comparable effects of moving water and vegetation on soundscape perception as seen for other traffic modalities in previous studies.","[""Acoustic quality"",""Aircraft noise"",""Effect of water"",""Experiment testing"",""Overall visual qualities"",""Residential site"",""Road traffic noise"",""Soundscapes""]","[""Aircraft noise"",""Soundscape"",""Urban planning"",""VR""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85042051259,,0

We prospectively studied 9333 hemodialysis patients in France, aiming to analyze associations between predialysis systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and nonfatal cardiovascular endpoints for a median follow-up of 548 days. Blood pressure components were tested against outcomes in time-varying covariate linear and fractional polynomial Cox models. Changes throughout follow-up were analyzed with a joint model including both the time-varying covariate of sequential blood pressure and its slope over time. A U-shaped association of systolic blood pressure was found with all-cause mortality and of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with cardiovascular mortality. There was an L-shaped association of diastolic blood pressure with all-cause mortality. The lowest hazard ratio of all-cause mortality was observed for a systolic blood pressure of 165 mm Hg, and of cardiovascular mortality for systolic/diastolic pressures of 157/90 mm Hg, substantially higher than currently recommended values for the general population. The 95% lower confidence interval was approximately 135/70 mm Hg. We found no significant correlation for either systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure with myocardial infarction or nontraumatic amputations, but there were significant positive associations between systolic and pulse pressure with stroke (per 10-mm Hg increase: hazard ratios 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.07 and 1.23; and 1.20, 1.11 and 1.31, respectively). Thus, whereas high pre-dialysis blood pressure is associated with stroke risk, low pre-dialysis blood pressure may be both harmful and a proxy for comorbid conditions leading to premature death.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Blood Pressure"",""Blood Pressure Determination"",""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Diastole"",""Female"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""France"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Prospective Studies"",""Renal Dialysis"",""Renal Insufficiency, Chronic"",""Risk Factors"",""Systole""]","[""cardiovascular disease"",""hemodialysis"",""hypertension""]",10.1016/j.kint.2016.05.025,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994210573,http://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085253816302745/pdf,0

However, long-distance electron transfer (LDET) by filamentous 'cable bacteria' has recently been discovered in marine sediments to couple spatially separated redox half reactions over centimeter scales. Here we provide primary evidence that such sulfur-oxidizing cable bacteria can also be found at oxic-anoxic interfaces in aquifer sediments, where they provide a means for the direct recycling of sulfate by electron transfer over 1-2-cm distance. Sediments were taken from a hydrocarbon-contaminated aquifer, amended with iron sulfide and saturated with water, leaving the sediment surface exposed to air. Steep geochemical gradients developed in the upper 3 cm, showing a spatial separation of oxygen and sulfide by 9 mm together with a pH profile characteristic for sulfur oxidation by LDET. Bacterial filaments, which were highly abundant in the suboxic zone, were identified by sequencing of 16S rRNA genes and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) as cable bacteria belonging to the Desulfobulbaceae. The detection of similar Desulfobulbaceae at the oxic-anoxic interface of fresh sediment cores taken at a contaminated aquifer suggests that LDET may indeed be active at the capillary fringe in situ.","[""Bacteria"",""Deltaproteobacteria"",""Electron Transport"",""Environmental Pollution"",""Geologic Sediments"",""Groundwater"",""Hydrocarbons"",""In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence"",""Oxidation-Reduction"",""Oxygen"",""RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"",""Sequence Analysis, DNA"",""Sulfates"",""Sulfides"",""Sulfur""]",,10.1038/ismej.2015.250,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964053648,https://www.nature.com/articles/ismej2015250.pdf,0

All rights reserved.Amorphous transition metal oxides are recognized as leading candidates for electrochromic window coatings that can dynamically modulate solar irradiation and improve building energy efficiency. However, their thin films are normally prepared by energy-intensive sputtering techniques or high-temperature solution methods, which increase manufacturing cost and complexity. Here, we report on a room-temperature solution process to fabricate electrochromic films of niobium oxide glass (NbOx) and 'nanocrystal-in-glass' composites (that is, tin-doped indium oxide (ITO) nanocrystals embedded in NbOx glass) via acid-catalysed condensation of polyniobate clusters. A combination of X-ray scattering and spectroscopic characterization with complementary simulations reveals that this strategy leads to a unique one-dimensional chain-like NbOx structure, which significantly enhances the electrochromic performance, compared to a typical three-dimensional NbOx network obtained from conventional high-temperature thermal processing. In addition, we show how self-assembled ITO-in-NbOx composite films can be successfully integrated into high-performance flexible electrochromic devices.","[""Building energy efficiency"",""Electrochromic performance"",""Flexible electrochromic device"",""High temperature solutions"",""Low temperature solutions"",""One-dimensional chains"",""Spectroscopic characterization"",""Tin doped indium oxide""]",,10.1038/nmat4734,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983484164,,0

The aim of the study is to identify the best antifungal drug for hematologic immunocompromised patients with CDC. Methods: In this multicentric retrospective study, the charts of 20 patients with CDC following cytotoxic agent protocols for hematological malignancies, diagnosed from 2003 to 2013, were analyzed. The response to systemic antifungal therapy within 90 days from CDC diagnosis and the possible delay in chemotherapy plan, due to the infection, were evaluated. Results: Six patients were treated with high-dose (HD; 5 mg/kg/daily) liposomal amphotericin B (L-AmB), whereas three received standard-dose (SD) L-AmB (3 mg/kg/daily). Azoles were given to six patients; the remaining five were treated with echinocandins. All patients treated with HD L-AmB (6/6—100 %) achieved complete resolution of CDC; one of them had to interrupt the chemotherapy program for the infection. In the SD L-AmB group, treatment failed in the 100 % of cases and one patient had to delay chemotherapy for the infection. Of the six patients who received azoles, two achieved complete resolution of the infection, four experienced treatment failure, and only three performed chemotherapy as planned. Echinocandins treatment resulted in complete resolution of the infection in 2/5 cases, partial response in 2/5 cases, and failure in one case. In this group, 3/5 patients completed chemotherapy as planned. Conclusions: This study shows that HD L-AmB was particularly effective against CDC in hematologic patients, allowing most patients to continue cytotoxic agent program.","[""Adult"",""Amphotericin B"",""Antifungal Agents"",""Candidiasis"",""Female"",""Hematologic Neoplasms"",""Humans"",""Immunocompromised Host"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Young Adult""]","[""Chronic disseminated candidiasis"",""Leukemia"",""Liposomal amphotericin B""]",10.1007/s00520-016-3208-0,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963674176,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00520-016-3208-0.pdf,0

We report the results of VC in infants from the Vaccinoscopie® study in 2014 to assess the changes secondary to the new 2013 immunization schedule. Method Study conducted on Internet among a representative sample of mothers reporting their child's vaccination record. Results The removal of the dose of DTPa-Hib at the age of 3 months was quickly adopted since only 1 % of children aged 6 months had received three doses of DTPa in 2014 compared to 96 % in 2012. The booster dose is administered earlier for the DTPa and hepatitis B components. The shift of MMR vaccination from 9 months of age for children participating in community structures to 12 months for all children was closely followed since only 2 % of 9- to 11-month-old children received a MMR vaccine in 2014 compared to 33 % in 2012. The second dose of MMR recommended at 16–18 months of age rather than between 13 and 24 months was actually followed by an earlier administration of this dose. At 18–20 months of age, 60 % received two doses of MMR in 2014 versus 41 % in 2012. Finally, for meningitis C vaccination, a significant increase of VC was observed in children 15–23 months of age (66 % in 2014 versus 44 % in 2012).

However, rapid modernisation also has implications for people’s norms and values, which can change—or fail to change—in line with these developments, with implications for life satisfaction. This paper looks at factors that affected life satisfaction in 2012–2013 using the most recent round of the World Values Survey. It uses a holistic framework for analysis derived from the social quality model by focusing upon socio-economic security, social cohesion, social inclusion and social empowerment. Using this societal approach, we found that 33 % of the variance in subjective well-being in China can be explained. Three of the four fields of social quality were important, but feelings of social empowerment make the largest contribution. We conclude that the economic changes that have taken place in China might have helped to move social norms in the direction of individualisation and a sense of personal agency, which raises life satisfaction for those that have made this adjustment. It also implies that the more gradualist transition policies introduced by China (in contrast to some former Soviet countries) allow people to cope better with social change.",,"[""China"",""Empowerment"",""Individualisation"",""Life satisfaction"",""Modernisation"",""Social cohesion"",""Social quality""]",10.1007/s11205-015-0989-3,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84929650668,http://hdl.handle.net/2164/8730,0

We explored the experiences and concerns of key actors in the informed consent process in two HIV clinical trials. Method Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 46 respondents including trial participants, research study team and research ethics committee members about their experiences during the informed consent process. Three focus group discussions were conducted with 14 Community Advisory Board (CAB) members and 17 trial participants. Data were analysed to identify key themes. Findings The consent process was highlighted as an important procedure by all the key actors however each group had a particular area of emphasis. Signing a consent form was given importance by research team and ethics committee members, because it provided documented evidence of a participant's willingness to join a clinical trial. Participants did not welcome the presence of a witness for a non-literate participant because understanding study information was not closely related to an ability to read and write. Conclusion This study's findings indicated that obtaining a volunteer's signature or thumbprint on a consent form did not necessarily mean that the participant was fully-informed about the information relevant to their taking part nor that they understood all the information shared with them.

Differences may also be explained by phylogenetic relationships. We compared different courtship traits, including male courtship sounds, in two sympatric Pomatoschistus species. Both species are characterised by having male and female courtship, and paternal care of eggs in nests under mussel shells and rocks. In addition to presenting novel observations, we reviewed the literature on courtship traits for both species and complemented it with new observations. We found that courting males of the common goby P. microps sing louder and produce sounds of shorter duration than males of the sand goby P. minutus. Furthermore, males of P. microps swim faster towards females during courtship than males of P. minutus. The eyes of P. minutus females turn black during courtship attempts, whereas this is not the case for females of P. microps.

In this study we evaluated whether RF-EMF model predictions at the home address are a good proxy of personal 48 h exposure. We furthermore studied potential modification of this association by degree of urbanisation. Method: We first used an initial NISMap estimation (at an assumed height of 4.5 m) for 9563 randomly selected addresses in order to oversample addresses with higher exposure levels and achieve exposure contrast. We included 47 individuals across the range of potential RF-EMF exposure and used NISMap to re-assess downlink exposure at the home address (at bedroom height). We computed several indicators to determine the accuracy of the NISMap model predictions. We compared residential RF-EMF model predictions with personal 48 h, at home, and night-time (0:00-8:00 AM) ExpoM3 measurements, and with EME-SPY 140 spot measurements in the bedroom. We obtained information about urbanisation degree and compared the accuracy of model predictions in high and low urbanised areas. Results: We found a moderate Spearman correlation between model predictions and personal 48 h (rSp = 0.47), at home (rSp = 0.49), at night (rSp = 0.51) and spot measurements (rSp = 0.54). We found no clear differences between high and low urbanised areas (48 h: high rSp = 0.38, low rSp = 0.55, bedroom spot measurements: high rSp = 0.55, low rSp = 0.50).

Our aim was to investigate whether women exposed to sexual violence as teenagers (12-19 years of age) or adults present with different obstetric outcomes than women with no record of such violence. Methods: We linked detailed prospectively collected information on women attending a Rape Trauma Service (RTS) to the Icelandic Medical Birth Registry (IBR). Women who attended the RTS in 1993-2010 and delivered (on average 5.8 years later) at least one singleton infant in Iceland through 2012 formed our exposed cohort (n = 1068). For each exposed woman's delivery, nine deliveries by women with no RTS attendance were randomly selected from the IBR (n = 9126) matched on age, parity, and year and season of delivery. Information on smoking and Body mass index (BMI) was available for a sub-sample (n = 792 exposed and n = 1416 non-exposed women). Poisson regression models were used to estimate Relative Risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: Compared with non-exposed women, exposed women presented with increased risks of maternal distress during labor and delivery (RR 1.68, 95% CI 1.01-2.79), prolonged first stage of labor (RR 1.40, 95% CI1.03-1.88), antepartum bleeding (RR 1.95, 95% CI1.22-3.07) and emergency instrumental delivery (RR 1.16, 95% CI1.00-1.34). Slightly higher risks were seen for women assaulted as teenagers. Overall, we did not observe differences between the groups regarding the risk of elective cesarean section (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.61-1.21), except for a reduced risk among those assaulted as teenagers (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.34-0.93). Adjusting for maternal smoking and BMI in a sub-sample did not substantially affect point estimates. Conclusion: Our prospective data suggest that women with a history of sexual assault, particularly as teenagers, are at increased risks of some adverse obstetric outcomes.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Child"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Iceland"",""Pregnancy"",""Pregnancy Outcome"",""Sex Offenses"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0150726,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962092219,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150726&type=printable,0

While protective paints that contain tributyltin or copper work well to prevent biofouling, release of these materials into the environment has been shown to have wider negative impacts. Consequently, new low-release antifouling paints are being developed with alternative active ingredients, such as avermectins, yet little is known about their potential effects on non-target organisms in marine environments. Here we investigated the toxicity of a key avermectin, specifically abamectin, on several aspects of reproduction (sperm motility, fertilisation success, early larval development) in the Pacific oyster, Crassostrea gigas. Oyster reproduction was generally insensitive to the low concentrations of abamectin, although greater concentrations of abamectin did negatively affect all three endpoints – LOECs were 1000 μg l−1, 500 μg l−1, and 100 μg l−1 abamectin for sperm motility, fertilisation success, and larval development, respectively. A similar pattern was found in the EC50s of the three endpoints (mean ± SE) 934 ± 59 μg l−1, 1076.26 ± 725.61 μg l−1, and 140 ± 78 μg l−1 abamectin (sperm motility, fertilisation success, and larval development, respectively). Together, these results clearly indicate that of the three endpoints considered, larval development was more sensitive to abamectin (lower LOEC, EC50) than fertilisation success and sperm motility. Although more data are needed from a wider range of marine species and environments to fully assess potential toxicity effects on non-target organisms, our results highlight the potential utility of abamectin in low-release antifouling paints.","[""Avermectins"",""Macrocyclic lactones"",""Marine invertebrates"",""SAAS"",""Sweden"",""Animals"",""Crassostrea"",""Fertilization"",""Ivermectin"",""Larva"",""Life Cycle Stages"",""Paint"",""Reproduction"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Avermectin"",""Bioassay"",""Macrocyclic lactones"",""Marine invertebrates"",""SAAS"",""Sweden""]",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.05.085,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019475886,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1557450/1/Styan_low%20sensitivity%20of%20reproductive_Pacific%20oyster.pdf,0

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Major depressive disorder is often associated with deficits in social and cognitive functioning. Mice transgenic for acid sphingomyelinase (t-ASM) were previously shown to have a depressive-like phenotype, which could be normalized by antidepressant treatment. Here, we investigated whether t-ASM mice show deficits in social behavior and memory performance, and whether these possible deficits might be normalized by amitriptyline treatment. Our results revealed that ASM overexpression altered the behavior of mice in a sex-dependent manner. As such, t-ASM female, but not male, mice showed an impaired social preference and a depressive- and anxiogenic-like phenotype, which could be normalized by amitriptyline treatment. Both male and female t-ASM mice showed unaltered preference for social novelty, novel object recognition, and social and object discrimination abilities. Amitriptyline treatment impaired novel object recognition and object discrimination abilities in female, but not in male, wild-type mice, while female t-ASM mice showed unaltered novel object recognition and object discrimination abilities. This study suggests that female t-ASM mice represent a model of depression with comorbid anxiety and social deficits, without memory impairments. It further suggests that ASM overexpression has a protective role against the detrimental effects of amitriptyline on female, but not on male, non-social (object) memory.","[""Amitriptyline"",""Animals"",""Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic"",""Anxiety"",""Behavior, Animal"",""Depression"",""Disease Models, Animal"",""Exploratory Behavior"",""Female"",""Gene Expression"",""Male"",""Memory"",""Mice"",""Mice, Transgenic"",""Pattern Recognition, Visual"",""Sex Factors"",""Social Behavior"",""Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase"",""Transgenes""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0162498,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992412003,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0162498&type=printable,0

Journal of Phycology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Phycological Society of America.Global climate change is expected to alter the polar bioregions faster than any other marine environment. This study assesses the biodiversity of seaweeds and associated eukaryotic pathogens of an established study site in northern Baffin Island (72° N), providing a baseline inventory for future work assessing impacts of the currently ongoing changes in the Arctic marine environment. A total of 33 Phaeophyceae, 24 Rhodophyceae, 2 Chlorophyceae, 12 Ulvophyceae, 1 Trebouxiophyceae, and 1 Dinophyceae are reported, based on collections of an expedition to the area in 2009, complemented by unpublished records of Robert T. Wilce and the first-ever photographic documentation of the phytobenthos of the American Arctic. Molecular barcoding of isolates raised from incubated substratum samples revealed the presence of 20 species of brown seaweeds, including gametophytes of kelp and of a previously unsequenced Desmarestia closely related to D. viridis, two species of Pylaiella, the kelp endophyte Laminariocolax aecidioides and 11 previously unsequenced species of the Ectocarpales, highlighting the necessity to include molecular techniques for fully unraveling cryptic algal diversity. This study also includes the first records of Eurychasma dicksonii, a eukaryotic pathogen affecting seaweeds, from the American Arctic. Overall, this study provides both the most accurate inventory of seaweed diversity of the northern Baffin Island region to date and can be used as an important basis to understand diversity changes with climate change.","[""Algal Proteins"",""Arctic Regions"",""Biodiversity"",""Chlorophyta"",""Islands"",""Nunavut"",""Phaeophyta"",""Phylogeny"",""Rhodophyta"",""Seaweed"",""Sequence Analysis, DNA""]","[""COI"",""cox3"",""Desmarestia"",""germling emergence"",""macroalgae"",""molecular barcoding"",""Phaeophyceae"",""Pylaiella""]",10.1111/jpy.12417,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027929554,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jpy.12417,0

Officially introduced in 1962–1963, but present earlier, the reasons for the long delay before its population exploded are discussed. The hypothesis that it occurred only after the haplochromine decline is evaluated, but haplochromines declined only after the Nile perch expansion began. The sudden eutrophication of the lake was attributed to Nile perch, but evidence of eutrophication from 1950 onwards led some researchers to conclude that it was the result of climatic changes. We conclude that the haplochromine destruction disrupted the complex food webs that existed prior to the upsurge of Nile perch. The depletion of fish biomass by Nile perch may have been the source of extra phosphorus responsible for the eutrophication of the lake. After the Nile perch explosion in 1980 the fish population came to be dominated by only three species, but fisheries productivity increased at least 10-fold. Fishing has caused demographic changes in Nile perch, which may have allowed some haplochromine species to recover. The condition of the lake appears to have stabilised since 2000, partly because the fish biomass has risen to at least 2 × 106 t, replacing the ‘lost’ biomass and restoring some ecosystem functioning.",,"[""eutrophication"",""fisheries production"",""haplochromines"",""non-native species""]",10.2989/16085914.2016.1157058,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975493584,,0

Use of virus-specific T lymphocytes (VSTs) has been successful for the treatment and prevention of viral infections after HSCT for malignant and nonmalignant conditions. Here we describe the clinical use of VSTs in patients with PIDs at 4 centers. Objective We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VSTs for treatment of viral infections in patients with PIDs. Methods Patients with PIDs who have received VST therapy on previous or current protocols were reviewed in aggregate. Clinical information, including transplantation details, viral infections, and use of antiviral and immunosuppressive pharmacotherapy, were evaluated. Data regarding VST production, infusions, and adverse reactions were compared. Results Thirty-six patients with 12 classes of PID diagnoses received 37 VST products before or after HSCT. Twenty-six (72%) patients had received a diagnosis of infection with cytomegalovirus, EBV, adenovirus, BK virus, and/or human herpesvirus 6. Two patients were treated before HSCT because of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease. Partial or complete responses against targeted viruses occurred in 81% of patients overall. Time to response varied from 2 weeks to 3 months (median, 28 days). Overall survival at 6 months after therapy was 80%. Four patients had graft-versus-host disease in the 45 days after VST infusion, which in most cases was therapy responsive. Conclusion VSTs derived from either stem cell donors or third-party donors are likely safe and effective for the treatment of viral infections in patients with PIDs.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Child"",""Child, Preschool"",""Graft vs Host Disease"",""Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation"",""Humans"",""Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes"",""Immunotherapy, Adoptive"",""Infant"",""T-Lymphocytes"",""Viral Load"",""Virus Diseases"",""Young Adult""]","[""antiviral therapy"",""cytotoxic T lymphocytes"",""immunotherapy"",""Primary immunodeficiency""]",10.1016/j.jaci.2015.12.1311,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959178137,http://www.jacionline.org/article/S0091674916001123/pdf,0

All rights reserved.Pancreatic cancer represents a real clinical challenge. The aim of the SUDCAN collaborative study was to compare the net survival from pancreatic cancer between six European Latin countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland) and provide trends in net survival and dynamics of excess mortality rates up to 5 years after diagnosis. The data were extracted from the EUROCARE-5 database. First, net survival was studied over the period 2000-2004 using the Pohar-Perme estimator. For trend analyses, the study period was specific to each country. Results were reported from 1992 to 2004 in France, Italy, Spain and Switzerland and from 2000 to 2004 in Belgium and Portugal. These analyses were carried out using a flexible excess rate modelling strategy. There were little differences between countries in age-standardized net survivals (2000-2004). The 5-year net survival was poor (range: 6-10%). The changes in net survival from 1992 to 2004 were mostly related to early survival and patients aged 60 years. A slight decrease in the excess mortality rate between 1992 and 2004 was observed, limited to the 18 months after diagnosis. This study confirmed that, despite some improvement, survival from pancreatic cancer is still poor throughout European Latin countries. The major improvements in clinical imaging did not result in improvements in prognosis. Development of truly innovative treatments is highly needed to improve prognosis.","[""Aged"",""Belgium"",""Databases, Factual"",""Europe"",""Female"",""France"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Pancreatic Neoplasms"",""Population Surveillance"",""Portugal"",""Registries"",""Spain"",""Survival Rate"",""Switzerland""]","[""Cancer registries"",""Europe"",""Excess mortality rate"",""Net survival"",""Pancreatic cancer"",""Trend analysis""]",10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000303,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010190157,,0

To this end, species distribution models (SDMs) are commonly applied, but seldom validated by completely independent data. Here, we use data on individual tracks derived from electronic tags as an alternative means of validating SDM outputs. Location: West coast of Scotland, NE Atlantic. Methods: We used a binomial generalized additive model (GAM) to predict the environmental suitability for flapper skate (Dipturus cf. intermedia) in Scottish waters. The GAM modelled relative habitat usage as a function of environmental variables using presence-absence data obtained from scientific trawl surveys. Additional data obtained from electronic tags attached to six individual flapper skates were used to estimate individual tracks using a tidal-based geolocation model. Concordance between individual tracks and GAM-predicted maps of relative habitat usage (RHU) was tested by comparing predicted RHU between estimated tracks and randomly generated tracks. Results: Environmental suitability for the flapper skate was driven by depth and distance from the coast in the SDM. We found high spatial concordance between the estimated tracks of the six tagged individuals and regions of high RHU predicted by the SDM. Main conclusions: Integrating outputs from an independent data source allowed us to validate predictions from a species distribution model (SDM). The integration of individual- and population-level data sources increases confidence in the outputs being used to define spatial conservation measures. The information on flapper skate distribution provided by this study provides a useful framework for considering spatial conservation measures for this species.",,"[""Data integration"",""Dipturus cf. intermedia"",""Generalized additive model"",""Individual movement"",""Model validation"",""Species distribution model"",""Tidal geolocation model""]",10.1111/ddi.12437,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961773674,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/ddi.12437,0

Particular concern is aroused by the several metals contained in photovoltaic panels whose potential release in the environment were scarcely investigated. Here, for the first time, the potential environmental hazard of panels produced in the last 30 years was investigated through the assessment of up to 18 releasable metals. Besides, the corresponding ecotoxicological effects were also evaluated. Experimental data were compared with the current European and Italian law limits for drinking water, discharge on soil and landfill inert disposal in order to understand the actual pollution load. Results showed that less than 3% of the samples respected all law limits and around 21% was not ecotoxic. By considering the technological evolutions in manufacturing, we have shown that during the years crystalline silicon panels have lower tendency to release hazardous metals with respect to thin film panels. In addition, a prediction of the amounts of lead, chromium, cadmium and nickel releasable from next photovoltaic waste was performed. The prevision up to 2050 showed high amounts of lead (30 t) and cadmium (2.9 t) releasable from crystalline and thin film panels respectively.","[""Crystalline silicons"",""Ecotoxicity"",""Ecotoxicological effects"",""Environmental hazards"",""Experimental investigations"",""Photovoltaic modules"",""Photovoltaic panels"",""Technological evolution"",""Animals"",""Chlorophyta"",""Daphnia"",""Energy-Generating Resources"",""Metals"",""Solar Energy"",""Vibrio"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Crystalline silicon"",""Ecotoxicity"",""Metals emission"",""Photovoltaic panel"",""Thin film""]",10.1016/j.jhazmat.2015.12.018,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961348589,,0

As a result of global change, land managers and policy makers are faced with changes to this landscape and need efficient evaluation techniques to assess cultural ecosystem services. This study provides a spatially explicit modelling approach to estimating aesthetic landscape values by relating spatial landscape patterns to human perceptions via a photo-based survey. The respondents attributed higher aesthetic values to the Alpine landscape in respect to areas with settlements, infrastructure or intensive agricultural use. The aesthetic value of two study areas in the Central Alps (Stubai Valley, Austria and Vinschgau, Italy) was modelled for 10,215 viewpoints along hiking trails according to current land cover and a scenario considering the spontaneous reforestation of abandoned land. Viewpoints with high aesthetic values were mainly located at high altitude, allowing long vistas, and included views of lakes or glaciers, and the lowest values were for viewpoints close to streets and in narrow valleys with little view. The aesthetic values of the reforestation scenario decreased mainly at higher altitudes, but the whole area was affected, reducing aesthetic value by almost 10% in Stubai Valley and 15% in Vinschgau. Our proposed modelling approach allows the estimation of aesthetic values in spatial and qualitative terms for most viewpoints in the European Alps. The resulting maps can be used as information and the basis for discussion by stakeholders, to support the decision-making process and landscape planning.

Despite the introduction of wastewater treatment plants and advanced chemical authorization procedures in Europe, chemical pollution is still a major threat to freshwater ecosystems.Here, large-scale monitoring data was exploited to identify taxon-specific chemical concentrations beyond which benthic invertebrate taxa are unlikely to occur using Threshold Indicator Taxa Analysis (TITAN). 365 invertebrate taxa and 25 organic chemicals including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, plasticisers, flame retardants, complexing agents, a surfactant and poly- and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons from a total of 399 sites were analysed. The number of taxa that responded to each of these chemicals varied between 0% and 21%. These sensitive taxa belonged predominantly to the groups Plecoptera, Coleoptera, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Turbellaria, Megaloptera, Crustacea, and Diptera. Strong effects were observed in response to wastewater-associated compounds, confirming that wastewater is an important cause of biological degradation. The majority of change points identified for each compound were well below predicted no-effect concentrations derived from laboratory toxicity studies. Thus, the results show that chemicals are likely to induce effects in the environment at concentrations much lower than expected based on laboratory experiments.Overall, it is confirmed that chemical pollution is still an important factor shaping the distribution of invertebrate taxa, suggesting the need for continued efforts to reduce chemical loads in rivers.","[""Environmental quality standards"",""Macroinvertebrates"",""Stream"",""Threshold"",""Water Framework Directives"",""Animals"",""Ecosystem"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Europe"",""Invertebrates"",""Rivers"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Environmental quality standard"",""Macroinvertebrate"",""Stream"",""Threshold"",""Water framework directive""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2015.12.006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949818533,,0

World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that either mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) or weight-for-height Z-scores (WHZ) are used to assess acute malnutrition prevalence. However, there are reports from several countries that the two criteria identify different children. In order to examine the external validity of these observations we have compared the direction and degree of discrepancy across countries. Methods: Anonymous data were collected from 1832 anthropometric surveys from 47 countries with measured children aged from 6 to 59 months and at least 75 malnourished subjects. The prevalence of total acute malnutrition and severe acute malnutrition was calculated using either absolute-MUAC or WHZ (WHO2006 standards). For each country, the total number of children diagnosed as acutely malnourished by either criterion alone or by both criteria were summed from all the surveys conducted in that country. Results: In all countries a minority of children were diagnosed as malnourished by both criteria. Both the magnitude and direction of the discrepancy varied dramatically between countries with some having most children diagnosed as malnourished by MUAC and others where nearly all the children were diagnosed by WHZ alone. Eight additional countries with insufficient malnourished children were also analysed and they support the conclusions. Conclusion: For all countries examined the discrepancy was not adequately explained by any single hypothesis, such as variation in relative leg to body length. The perceived need for humanitarian intervention can be affected by the measurement chosen to assess the prevalence of malnutrition which will vary from region to region. It is recommended that MUAC measurement be included in all anthropometric surveys and that the two criteria are not alternative measures of the loss of body tissue leading to an increased risk of death, but complementary variables that should both be used independently to guide admission for treatment of malnourished children.",,"[""Acute malnutrition"",""Child"",""Human"",""Mid-upper-arm circumference"",""MUAC"",""Nutrition"",""Severe acute malnutrition"",""Survey"",""Wasting"",""Weight-for-height""]",10.1186/s40795-016-0049-7,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85001591849,https://bmcnutr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40795-016-0049-7,0

However, we know little about any possible interactions between exposure to these microorganisms and the effects of climate change on bivalve health, or about how this may affect the bivalve toxin-pathogen load. In mesocosm experiments, mussels, Perna viridis, were subjected to simulated climate change (warming and/or hyposalinity) and exposed to harmful bacteria and/or toxin-producing dinoflagellates. We found significant interactions between climate change and these microbes on metabolic and/or immunobiological function and toxin-pathogen load in mussels. Surprisingly, however, these effects were virtually eliminated when mussels were exposed to both harmful microorganisms simultaneously.

Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Ocean acidification is expected to have dramatic impacts on oceanic ecosystems, yet surprisingly few studies currently examine long-term adaptive and plastic responses of marine invertebrates to pCO2 stress. Here, we exposed populations of the common copepod Pseudocalanus acuspes to three pCO2 regimes (400, 900, and 1550 μatm) for two generations, after which we conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment. A de novo transcriptome was assembled, annotated, and gene expression data revealed that genes involved in RNA transcription were strongly down-regulated in populations with long-term exposure to a high pCO2 environment, even after transplantation back to control levels. In addition, 747 000 SNPs were identified, out of which 1513 showed consistent changes in nucleotide frequency between replicates of control and high pCO2 populations. Functions involving RNA transcription and ribosomal function, as well as ion transport and oxidative phosphorylation, were highly overrepresented. We thus conclude that pCO2 stress appears to impose selection in copepods on RNA synthesis and translation, possibly modulated by helicase expression. Using a physiological hypothesis-testing strategy to mine gene expression data, we herein increase the power to detect cellular targets of ocean acidification.

Their formulations are mainly based on empirical laws involving many parameters. Improving biogeochemical models therefore requires to properly characterize model uncertainties and their consequences. Subsequently, this paper investigates the potential of using random processes to simulate some uncertainties of the 1/4° coupled Physical-Biogeochemical NEMO/PISCES model of the North Atlantic ocean.Starting from a deterministic simulation performed with the original PISCES formulation, we propose a generic method based on AR(1) random processes to generate perturbations with temporal and spatial correlations. These perturbations are introduced into the model formulations to simulate 2 classes of uncertainties: the uncertainties on biogeochemical parameters and the uncertainties induced by unresolved scales in the presence of non-linear processes. Using these stochastic parameterizations, a probabilistic version of PISCES is designed and a 60-member ensemble simulation is performed.With respect to the simulation of chlorophyll, the relevance of the probabilistic configuration and the impacts of these stochastic parameterizations are assessed. In particular, it is shown that the ensemble simulation is in good agreement with the SeaWIFS ocean color data. Using these observations, the statistical consistency (reliability) of the ensemble is evaluated with rank histograms. Finally, the benefits expected from the probabilistic description of uncertainties (model error) are discussed in the context of future ocean color data assimilation.","[""Data assimilation"",""Deterministic simulation"",""Ocean color"",""PISCES"",""Probabilistic descriptions"",""Statistical consistencies"",""Stochastic simulations"",""Temporal and spatial correlation""]","[""Data assimilation"",""Ocean color data"",""PISCES"",""Reliability"",""Stochastic simulations""]",10.1016/j.jmarsys.2015.10.012,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949009963,,0

Infertility, gonadal and sexual dysfunction are usually the most relevant clinical features in both sexes.Area covered: This review focuses on safety and tolerability of therapeutic approaches for prolactinomas. Complications from trans-sphenoidal surgery vary depending on tumor size, and mortality rate ranges 0.6%-31% for patients with microprolactinomas and macroprolactinoms, respectively. More than 50% of patients receiving pituitary radiotherapy will develop at least one hormone deficiency within the following decade, whereas cerebrovascular accidents, second brain tumors and optic neuropathy rarely occur. Nowadays, treatment of prolactinomas is based on dopamine-agonists (DA), mainly cabergoline (CAB). Whether CAB is associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant cardiac valvulopathy in patients with prolactinomas as in those with Parkinsons disease (PD), is still debated. In most studies, CAB has been found not to be associated with an increased risk of significant valvulopathy in prolactinomas, and no correlation has been shown between valvular abnormalities and CAB duration or cumulative dose.Expert opinion: DA are safe and well tolerated, and the main safety concerns are related to the potential risk of clinically relevant valvulopathy following treatment with CAB, rarely occurring in patients with prolactinomas.","[""Animals"",""Antineoplastic Agents"",""Dopamine Agonists"",""Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"",""Ergolines"",""Humans"",""Pituitary Neoplasms"",""Prolactinoma"",""Safety""]","[""bromocriptine"",""cabergoline"",""cardiac valvulopathy"",""dopamine agonists"",""Hyperprolactinemia"",""macroadenoma"",""microadenoma"",""pituitary tumor"",""radiotherapy"",""safety"",""surgery""]",10.1517/14740338.2016.1151493,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961197361,,0

Bats are also very sensitive to human actions, and significant declines in many bat populations have been recorded consequently. Many bat species find crucial roosting and foraging opportunities in European forests. Such forests have historically been exploited by humans and are still influenced by harvesting. One of the consequences of this pressure is the loss of key habitat resources, often making forests inhospitable to bats. Despite the legal protection granted to bats across Europe, the impacts of forestry on bats are still often neglected. Because forest exploitation influences forest structure at several spatial scales, economically viable forestry could become more sustainable and even favor bats. We highlight that a positive future for bat conservation that simultaneously benefits forestry is foreseeable, although more applied research is needed to develop sound management. Key future research topics include the detection of factors influencing the carrying capacity of forests, and determining the impacts of forest management and the economic importance of bats in forests.

In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a three-stage on-farm biobed for treating pesticide contaminated wastewater from a large (20 km2) commercial arable estate. The facility consisted of an enclosed machinery wash-down unit (stage 1), a 49 m2 lined compost-straw-topsoil biobed (stage 2), and a 200 m2 drainage field with a trickle irrigation system (stage 3). Pesticide concentrations were analysed in water samples collected fortnightly between November 2013 and November 2015 from the biobed input and output sumps and from 20 porous pots buried at 45 cm and 90 cm depth within the drainage field. The results revealed that the biobed removed 68–98% of individual pesticides within the contaminated washings, with mean total pesticide concentrations reducing by 91.6% between the biobed input and output sumps. Drainage field irrigation removed a further 68–99% of individual pesticides, with total mean pesticide concentrations reducing by 98.4% and 97.2% in the 45 cm and 90 cm depth porous pots, respectively. The average total pesticide concentration at 45 cm depth in the drainage field (57 μg L−1) was 760 times lower than the mean concentration recorded in the input sump (43,334 μg L−1). There was no evidence of seasonality in the efficiency of biobed pesticide removal, nor was there evidence of a decline in removal efficiency over the two-year monitoring period. However, higher mean total pesticide concentrations at 90 cm (102 μg L−1) relative to 45 cm (57 μg L−1) depth indicated an accumulation of pesticide residues deeper within the soil profile. Overall, the results presented here demonstrate that a three-stage biobed can successfully reduce pesticide pollution risk from contaminated machinery washings on a commercial farm.","[""Agricultural Irrigation"",""Agriculture"",""Equipment Design"",""Farms"",""Pesticide Residues"",""Pesticides"",""Soil"",""United Kingdom"",""Waste Disposal, Fluid"",""Waste Water"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Arable"",""Biobed"",""Biodegradation"",""Herbicide"",""Pesticide"",""Water quality""]",10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.06.047,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995752394,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/59763/1/Cooper_et_al_Revised_Manuscript_Final.pdf,0

It was said, history came to an end, and western id eas became the leading ideology. Democracy in all its variations spread and was adopted by more and more countries and societies. The victory of western ideas meant also the triumph of capitalism and liberalization policies were increasingly pursued as the new economic paradigm. By pushing for open markets and free-trade, this economic shift was strongly promoted by the Bretton Woods Institutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO).

It is therefore of paramount importance to improve our understanding of links between Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) variability, climate change and sustainability of tropical coral reef ecosystems. Here we present monthly resolved coral Srĝ•Ca records from two different locations from Rodrigues Island (63°E, 19°S) in the south-central Indian Ocean trade wind belt. We reconstruct SST based on a linear relationship with the Srĝ•Ca proxy with records starting from 1781 and 1945, respectively. We assess relationships between the observed long-term SST and climate fluctuations related to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole Mode (SIOD) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) between 1945 and 2006, respectively. The reproducibility of the Srĝ•Ca records is assessed as are the potential impacts of diagenesis and corallite orientation on Srĝ•Ca-SST reconstructions. We calibrate individual robust Srĝ•Ca records with in situ SST and various gridded SST products. The results show that the SST record from Cabri provides the first Indian Ocean coral proxy time series that records the SST signature of the PDO in the south-central Indian Ocean since 1945.

This crystallised an ambition first enshrined in law over five decades earlier, but never previously realised. This paper explores Indonesia's journey towards universal health coverage (UHC) from independence to the launch of a comprehensive health insurance scheme in January 2014. We find that Indonesia's path has been determined largely by domestic political concerns - different groups obtained access to healthcare as their socio-political importance grew. A major inflection point occurred following the Asian financial crisis of 1997. To stave off social unrest, the government provided health coverage for the poor for the first time, creating a path dependency that influenced later policy choices. The end of this programme coincided with decentralisation, leading to experimentation with several different models of health provision at the local level. When direct elections for local leaders were introduced in 2005, popular health schemes led to success at the polls. UHC became an electoral asset, moving up the political agenda. It also became contested, with national policy-makers appropriating health insurance programmes that were first developed locally, and taking credit for them. The Indonesian experience underlines the value of policy experimentation, and of a close understanding of the contextual and political factors that drive successful UHC models at the local level. Specific drivers of success and failure should be taken into account when scaling UHC to the national level. In the Indonesian example, UHC became possible when the interests of politically and economically influential groups were either satisfied or neutralised. While technical considerations took a back seat to political priorities in developing the structures for health coverage nationally, they will have to be addressed going forward to achieve sustainable UHC in Indonesia.","[""Health Policy"",""Healthcare Financing"",""Humans"",""Indonesia"",""Insurance, Health"",""Politics"",""Universal Coverage""]","[""Decentralisation"",""Experimentalist governance"",""Health financing"",""Health insurance"",""Indonesia"",""Path dependence"",""Social protection"",""Universal Health Coverage""]",10.1093/heapol/czw120,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019714510,https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-pdf/32/2/267/10478148/czw120.pdf,0

Our results confirmed that decreasing seawater pH and decreasing saturation state increases larval mortality rate and the percentage of abnormally developing larvae. Virtually no larvae reared at average pH T 7.16 were able to feed or reach the D-shell stage and their development appeared to be arrested at the trochophore stage. However larvae were capable of reaching the D-shell stage under milder acidification (pH T 7.35, 7.6, 7.85) including in under-saturated seawater with Ωa as low as 0.54 ± 0.01 (mean ± s. e. m.), with a tipping point for normal development identified at pH T 7.765. Additionally growth rate of normally developing larvae was not affected by lower pH T despite potential increased energy costs associated with compensatory calcification in response to increased shell dissolution. Overall, our results on OA impacts on mussel larvae suggest an average pH T of 7.16 is beyond their physiological tolerance threshold and indicate a shift in energy allocation towards growth in some individuals revealing potential OA resilience.","[""Adaptation, Physiological"",""Algorithms"",""Analysis of Variance"",""Animals"",""Calcification, Physiologic"",""Calcium Carbonate"",""Carbonates"",""Feeding Behavior"",""Fluoresceins"",""Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"",""Larva"",""Microscopy, Confocal"",""Mytilus edulis"",""Seawater""]",,10.1038/srep23728,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962425251,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep23728.pdf,0

In social sciences, the term of “trajectory” is often used to describe some evolution that is not necessarily related to some geographical movement. In this paper, we propose ontological design patterns that (i) allow modelling multiple spatial or aspatial trajectories and (ii) include explanatory factors for a better understanding of trajectory events. Algorithms for the exploitation of our patterns are also presented. As a case study, we model the multiple trajectories that compose a life trajectory having in mind to focus on and study residential choices.

In the context of Brazil, a country with extremely high regional disparities, exploring this issue is important not only for private stakeholders but also for public policy practitioners. In the framework of static agglomeration effects, we investigate the industrial scope of agglomeration economies in Brazil. On the basis of identified registration data which cover the whole formal labour market in three particular years (2004, 2008 and 2012), we estimate separate models for the logarithm of the hourly individual wage for five broad economic sectors (S1—Manufacturing low-tech; S2—Manufacturing medium-tech; S3—Manufacturing high-tech; S4—Services less-knowledge; and S5—Services high-knowledge). Different estimation strategies are considered in a two-stage model: with and without individual fixed effects in the first stage; and with and without instrumental variables for population density in the second stage. The main results indicate that there is no unique optimal local industrial mix to foster productivity in different technological sectors. Comparing possible theoretical approaches (Marshall–Arrow–Romer, Jacobs, Porter) related to combinations of diversity, specialisation and competition, we find that for S5 only diversity is significant (and positive), suggesting that Jacobs’s perspective is adequate. However, for S1, S2 and S4, the MAR framework seems better able to explain the underlying patterns. In the case of S3, there are elements from both Marshall’s and Jacobs’s perspective. These results seem to be robust to different specifications and estimation strategies. Finally, the urbanisation economies coefficient appears to be positive and significant for all sectors, ranging from 0.0511 to 0.0940 in different specifications, under the simplest estimation (OLS in the first and the second stages). Ordering these effects between the sectors from the highest to the lowest, we find the following sequence: S3, S1, S5, S4 and S2. This can be considered as evidence that high-tech and low-tech manufacturing sectors benefit more from the urban or metropolitan scale in Brazil, followed by services associated with higher knowledge intensity.",,"[""J31"",""R23"",""R32""]",10.1007/s00168-016-0768-3,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84970963364,http://www.repec.eae.fea.usp.br/documentos/Barufi_Haddad_Nijkamp_13WP.pdf,0

We prospectively studied 9333 hemodialysis patients in France, aiming to analyze associations between predialysis systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and nonfatal cardiovascular endpoints for a median follow-up of 548 days. Blood pressure components were tested against outcomes in time-varying covariate linear and fractional polynomial Cox models. Changes throughout follow-up were analyzed with a joint model including both the time-varying covariate of sequential blood pressure and its slope over time. A U-shaped association of systolic blood pressure was found with all-cause mortality and of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure with cardiovascular mortality. There was an L-shaped association of diastolic blood pressure with all-cause mortality. The lowest hazard ratio of all-cause mortality was observed for a systolic blood pressure of 165 mm Hg, and of cardiovascular mortality for systolic/diastolic pressures of 157/90 mm Hg, substantially higher than currently recommended values for the general population. The 95% lower confidence interval was approximately 135/70 mm Hg. We found no significant correlation for either systolic, diastolic, or pulse pressure with myocardial infarction or nontraumatic amputations, but there were significant positive associations between systolic and pulse pressure with stroke (per 10-mm Hg increase: hazard ratios 1.15, 95% confidence interval 1.07 and 1.23; and 1.20, 1.11 and 1.31, respectively).

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting A nationwide longitudinal dataset of the the Netherlands Perinatal Registry. Population Women with three sequential singleton pregnancies between 1999 and 2009 and a spontaneous preterm birth <37 weeks in the first pregnancy. Methods We evaluated the impact of interpregnancy interval on the course of the next pregnancies. Antenatal death and/or congenital abnormalities were excluded. Conventional and conditional logistic regression analysis were applied. We adjusted for maternal age, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, artificial reproductive techniques, and year of birth. Main Outcome Measures Outcomes studied were preterm birth <37 weeks, <32 weeks, low birth weight <2500 g, and small for gestational age <10th percentile. Results Among 2,361 women with preterm birth in the first pregnancy, logistic regression analysis indicated a significant effect of a short interpregnancy interval (0-5 mo) on recurrent preterm birth <37 weeks (odds ratio [OR], 2.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.62-3.05), <32 weeks (OR, 2.90; 95% CI, 1.43-5.87), and low birth weight (OR, 2.69; 95% CI, 1.79-4.03). In addition, a long interval (≥60 mo) had a significant effect on preterm birth <37 weeks (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.29-3.74). Conditional logistic regression analysis confirmed the effect of a short interval on the recurrence of preterm birth rate <37 weeks and low birth weight. Conclusion In women with a previous spontaneous preterm birth, a short interpregnancy interval has a strong impact on the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks and low birth weight in the next pregnancy, irrespective of the type of analysis performed.","[""Adult"",""Birth Intervals"",""Female"",""Gestational Age"",""Humans"",""Infant, Low Birth Weight"",""Infant, Small for Gestational Age"",""Logistic Models"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Netherlands"",""Pregnancy"",""Premature Birth"",""Recurrence"",""Registries"",""Regression Analysis"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Young Adult""]","[""interpregnancy interval"",""preterm birth"",""recurrence risk"",""spontaneous""]",10.1055/s-0036-1584896,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976871779,,0

This is highly relevant in the private land conservation (PLC) sector given the low participation rates of landholders. Using a case study of PLC schemes targeted at Australian landholders, we present the first systematic analysis of communication strategies used by organisations and government departments delivering those schemes to engage the public. We develop a novel approach for analysing the framing of conservation messages that codes the stated benefits of schemes according to value orientation. We categorised the benefits as flowing to either the landholder, to society, or to the environment, corresponding to the egoistic, altruistic and biospheric value orientations that have been shown to influence human behaviour. We find that messages are biased towards environmental benefits. Surprisingly, this is the case even for market-based schemes that have the explicit objective of appealing to production-focussed landholders and those who are not already involved in conservation. The risk is that PLC schemes framed in this way will fail to engage more egoistically oriented landholders and are only likely to appeal to those likely to already be conservation-minded. By understanding the frame in which PLC benefits are communicated, we can begin to understand the types of people who may be engaged by these messages, and who may not be. Results suggest that the framing of the communications for many schemes could be broadened to appeal to a more diverse group (and thus ultimately to a larger group) of landholders.",,"[""Biodiversity"",""Communications"",""Conservation"",""Framing"",""Market-based instruments"",""Marketing"",""Private land conservation"",""Value orientation"",""Value orientation""]",10.1016/j.envsci.2016.03.016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963677216,,0

Higher values of carbon fluxes were found during the wet season at each site. A strong dependency of carbon fluxes on water relations was found in two contrasting sites. The forest sequestered 640 ± 50 and the savannah 190 ± 40 g C m−2year−1. Context: In West Africa, the main mechanisms or factors governing the dynamics of ecosystems, especially the dynamics of the carbon fluxes and productivity, still remain less known. This study reports the carbon fluxes over two contrasting ecosystems, notably a protected forest (lat 9.79°N, long 1.72°E, alt 414 m) and a cultivated savannah (lat 9.74°N, long 1.60°E, alt 449 m) in northern Benin. The two sites were among those equipped by the AMMA-CATCH observatory and Ouémé 2025 project. Aims: Flux data were analyzed at the daily and seasonal scales in order to understand their controlling variables. We discussed the patterns of CO2 fluxes and the characteristics of the two ecosystems. The study also focused on the different water usage strategies developed by the two ecosystems since the alternation between dry and wet seasons highly influenced the seasonal dynamics. Finally, the annual carbon sequestration was estimated together with its uncertainty. Methods: The carbon fluxes were measured during 18 months (July 2008–December 2009) by an eddy-covariance system over two contrasting sites in northern Benin. Fluxes data were computed following the standard procedure. The responses of CO2 fluxes to the principal climatic and edaphic factors, and the canopy conductance were studied. Results: A clear CO2 fluxes response to main environmental factors was observed, however with difference according to the seasons and vegetation types. The ecosystem respiration showed the highest values during the wet season and a progressive decrease from wet to dry periods. Also, the carbon uptake values were high during the wet period, but low during the dry period. However, the CO2 fluxes for the protected forest were always higher than that for the cultivated savannah within each defined period. This was due to the seasonal changes not only in phenology and physiology but also to the acclimation to environmental conditions, especially to the soil water availability. The water use efficiency was influenced by VPD during the day conditions for two ecosystems. However, the VPD response curve of water usage was relatively constant for the protected forest during the transitional and wet seasons. In contrary, for the cultivated savannah the VPD response decreased about 46 % from transitional dry-wet to wet seasons and remained relatively constant until transitional wet-dry season. The close relationships between the net CO2 assimilation and the canopy conductance were found for the two ecosystems. This suggests a regulation of the stomata by a partial stomatal closure besides the radiation control. Finally, the forest sequestered at the annual scale 640 ± 50 and the savannah 190 ± 40 g C m−2 year−1. Conclusion: We conclude with a strong relation between the carbon fluxes and water in the two investigated ecosystems. Apart from the radiation control, the stomata also play an important role in the regulation of the CO2 assimilation in the two ecosystems.",,"[""Benin"",""CO2 fluxes"",""Ecosystem respiration"",""Eddy covariance"",""Forest"",""Productivity"",""Savannah"",""Water usage"",""West Africa""]",10.1007/s13595-016-0542-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971238740,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13595-016-0542-9.pdf,0

This effect has often been attributed to perioperative α‑receptor blockade. However, this has never been tested in a randomized trial and many other changes have contributed to this improvement. At the same time α‑receptor blockade was introduced, short-acting and well controllable agents became available for intraoperative arterial blood pressure management. Subsequently, surgical techniques improved and led almost exclusively to minimally invasive techniques, while improvements in the diagnostic techniques allow earlier and more precise detection of catecholamine-producing tumors. Methods: Conduction of a randomized, controlled study to investigate the effect of α‑receptor blockade on mortality is hampered by the rarity of the disease. With the currently low mortality rate, several thousands of patients would be needed to test such a hypothesis. Accordingly, intraoperative management is generally based on expert opinion. Hypertensive episodes are treated by intravenous administration of sodium nitroprusside, urapidil or nitroglycerine. Depending on the individual case a short-acting β‑blocker and magnesium might be added. Hypotension following tumor removal is treated with intravenous fluid infusion and continuous norepinephrine administration. Adrenal gland-sparing resection of pheochromocytoma does not seem to increase the risk of arterial hypertension. Conclusion: Future research should focus on identification of risk factors for intraoperative hypertensive episodes and the question whether a time-consuming, unreliable α‑receptor blockade, burdened with significant side effects, is still needed.","[""Adrenal Gland Neoplasms"",""Adrenalectomy"",""Anesthetics"",""Antihypertensive Agents"",""Evidence-Based Medicine"",""Humans"",""Hypertension"",""Monitoring, Intraoperative"",""Pheochromocytoma"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""Alpha-receptor blockade"",""Blood pressure control"",""Hypotension"",""Paraganglioma"",""Sodium nitroprusside""]",10.1007/s00120-016-0082-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966552333,,0

Prior to January 2015, the ship used a heavy fuel oil (HFO) but switched to a low-sulfur residual marine fuel oil (RMB30) after the implementation of the new FSC limit. The emitted particulate matter (PM) was measured in terms of mass, number, size distribution, volatility, elemental composition, content of organics, black and elemental carbon, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), microstructure and micro-composition, along with the gaseous emissions at different operating conditions. The fuel change reduced emissions of PM mass up to 67%. The number of particles emitted remained unchanged and were dominated by nanoparticles. Furthermore, the fuel change resulted in an 80% reduction of SO2 emissions and decreased emissions of total volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The emissions of both monoaromatic and lighter polyaromatic hydrocarbon compounds increased with RMB30, while the heavy, PM-bound PAH species that belong to the carcinogenic PAH family were reduced. Emissions of BC remained similar between the two fuels. This study indicates that the use of low-sulfur residual marine fuel oil is a way to comply with the new FSC regulation and will reduce the anthropogenic load of SO2 emissions and secondary PM formed from SO2. Emissions of primary particles, however, remain unchanged and do not decrease as much as would be expected if distilled fuel was used. This applies both to the number of particles emitted and some toxic components, such as heavy metals, PAHs or elemental carbon (EC). The micro-composition analyses showed that the soot particles emitted from RMB30 combustion often do not have any trace of sulfur compared with particles from HFO combustion, which always have a sulfur content over 1%m/m. The soot sulfur content can impact aging and cloud condensation properties. This study is an in-depth comparison of the impact of these two fuels on the emissions of particles as well as their composition and microstructure. To evaluate the impact of the use of low-sulfur residual marine fuel oils on emissions from ships, additional research is needed to investigate the varied fuel types and compositions as well as the wide range of engine conditions and properties.","[""Different operating conditions"",""Emission factors"",""Marine fuels"",""Micro-composition analysis"",""Particle emissions"",""Polyaromatic hydrocarbons"",""Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS)"",""SECA""]","[""Emission factor"",""Gas emission"",""Marine fuel"",""Particle emission"",""SECA""]",10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.09.022,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988975291,,0

Infertility, gonadal and sexual dysfunction are usually the most relevant clinical features in both sexes.Area covered: This review focuses on safety and tolerability of therapeutic approaches for prolactinomas. Complications from trans-sphenoidal surgery vary depending on tumor size, and mortality rate ranges 0.6%-31% for patients with microprolactinomas and macroprolactinoms, respectively. More than 50% of patients receiving pituitary radiotherapy will develop at least one hormone deficiency within the following decade, whereas cerebrovascular accidents, second brain tumors and optic neuropathy rarely occur. Nowadays, treatment of prolactinomas is based on dopamine-agonists (DA), mainly cabergoline (CAB). Whether CAB is associated with an increased risk of clinically relevant cardiac valvulopathy in patients with prolactinomas as in those with Parkinsons disease (PD), is still debated. In most studies, CAB has been found not to be associated with an increased risk of significant valvulopathy in prolactinomas, and no correlation has been shown between valvular abnormalities and CAB duration or cumulative dose.Expert opinion: DA are safe and well tolerated, and the main safety concerns are related to the potential risk of clinically relevant valvulopathy following treatment with CAB, rarely occurring in patients with prolactinomas.","[""Animals"",""Antineoplastic Agents"",""Dopamine Agonists"",""Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions"",""Ergolines"",""Humans"",""Pituitary Neoplasms"",""Prolactinoma"",""Safety""]","[""bromocriptine"",""cabergoline"",""cardiac valvulopathy"",""dopamine agonists"",""Hyperprolactinemia"",""macroadenoma"",""microadenoma"",""pituitary tumor"",""radiotherapy"",""safety"",""surgery""]",10.1517/14740338.2016.1151493,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961197361,,0

All rights reserved.The building of the Edinburgh New Town, from the mid-18th to the mid-19th centuries, was a major advance in harmonious and elegant town planning. However, there is anecdotal evidence that it led to the occurrence of an epidemic of silicosis/tuberculosis among the stonemasons. We have reviewed contemporary accounts of the episode and early records of the understanding of silicosis. We have also studied the lung of a contemporary stonemason, preserved in the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, and confirmed the presence of silico-tuberculosis in it. The evidence shows that a major epidemic did occur, caused by a combination of factors. The size of the undertaking attracted many stonemasons to Edinburgh over a period of almost 100 years, intensively cutting and dressing stone. The principal stone worked was a very high-quartz sandstone, derived from the local Craigleith quarry, having properties that made it desirable for prestige buildings. However, even before the construction of the New Town, Craigleith sandstone was notorious for its dustiness and the Edinburgh stonemasons worked the stone in unventilated sheds. Stonemasons appeared to be aware of the risk of their trade, but little was known about preventive measures. It appears it was assumed that the risks to stonemasons disappeared after the Craigleith quarry closed, the employers emphasising (without evidence) the lack of health risks in other quarries, and the tragic episode appears to have been forgotten. However, we point to the continuing occurrence of silicosis among stonemasons to the present day; the importance of remembering such episodes is stressed lest the lessons of the past be forgotten.","[""Cities"",""Construction Industry"",""Dust"",""Epidemics"",""History, 18th Century"",""History, 19th Century"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Scotland"",""Silicosis"",""Tuberculosis, Pulmonary""]","[""Edinburgh"",""New Town"",""Quartz"",""Silica"",""Silicosis"",""Stonemasons"",""Tuberculosis""]",10.4997/JRCPE.2017.416,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85037663424,https://doi.org/10.4997/jrcpe.2017.416,0

Framed within the context of the latest emissions budgets, and their associated uncertainty, we present a summary of the contribution of BECCS within the Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) scenarios used by the climate change community. Within this discussion we seek to shed light on two important areas. Firstly, that BECCS is a central, but often hidden element of many of the modelling work that underpins climate policy from the global to the national scale. The second area we address are the assumptions for BECCS embedded within IAM models, and the wider system consequences of these implied levels of deployment.

In two studies, we examined whether meritocracy values also influence female observers when they judge a female victim of sexism. Such values were expected to lead them to judge more positively a victim incriminating herself than a victim claiming discrimination. Conversely, social equality values should lead them to judge more positively a victim claiming discrimination. Women who were either feminists or non-feminists (Study 1) or who were exposed to either social equality values or personal merit values (Study 2) had to judge a female victim of sexism who ascribed what happened to discrimination or to her ability. Feminist women and women exposed to social equality judged the female victim more positively when she reported discrimination than when she incriminated herself.

There is a growing literature on an increasingly ubiquitous puzzle in many democratic countries: that corrupt officials continue to be re-elected by voters. In this study we address this issue with a novel theory and newly collected original survey data for 24 European countries. The crux of the argument is that voters' ideology is a salient factor in explaining why citizens would continue voting for their preferred party despite the fact that it has been involved in a corruption scandal. Developing a theory of supply (number of effective parties) and demand (voters must have acceptable ideological alternatives to their preferred party), we posit that there is a U-shaped relationship between the likelihood of corruption voting and where voters place themselves on the left/right spectrum. The further to the fringes, the more likely the voters are to neglect corruption charges and continue to support their party. However, as the number of viable party alternatives increases, the effect of ideology is expected to play a smaller role. In systems with a large number of effective parties, the curve is expected to be flat, as the likelihood that the fringe voters also have a clean and reasonably ideologically close alternative to switch to. The hypothesis implies a cross level interaction for which we find strong and robust empirical evidence using hierarchical modeling. In addition, we provide empirical insights about how individual level ideology and country level party systems - among other factors - impact a voter's decision to switch parties or stay home in the face of their party being involved in a corruption scandal.",,"[""Corruption"",""Electoral outcomes"",""Europe"",""Party systems"",""Voter ideology"",""Voting behavior""]",10.1016/j.electstud.2015.11.022,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949659482,,0

The sand has been mostly produced by glacio-fluvial processes, leaving behind fine-grained unstable sediments which are later re-distributed by repeated aeolian events. Volcanic eruptions add to this pool of unstable sediments, often from subglacial eruptions. Icelandic desert surfaces are divided into sand fields, sandy lavas and sandy lag gravel, each with separate aeolian surface characteristics such as threshold velocities. Storms are frequent due to Iceland's location on the North Atlantic Storm track. Dry winds occur on the leeward sides of mountains and glaciers, in spite of the high moisture content of the Atlantic cyclones. Surface winds often move hundreds to more than 1000 kg m-1 per annum, and more than 10,000 kg m-1 have been measured in a single storm. Desertification occurs when aeolian processes push sand fronts and have thus destroyed many previously fully vegetated ecosystems since the time of the settlement of Iceland in the late ninth century. There are about 135 dust events per annum, ranging from minor storms to >300,000 t of dust emitted in single storms. Dust production is on the order of 30-40 million tons annually, some traveling over 1000 km and deposited on land and sea. Dust deposited on deserts tends to be re-suspended during subsequent storms. High PM10 concentrations occur during major dust storms. They are more frequent in the wake of volcanic eruptions, such as after the Eyjafjallajökull 2010 eruption. Airborne dust affects human health, with negative effects enhanced by the tubular morphology of the grains, and the basaltic composition with its high metal content. Dust deposition on snow and glaciers intensifies melting. Moreover, the dust production probably also influences atmospheric conditions and parameters that affect climate change.",,"[""Climate"",""Deserts"",""Dust"",""Snow"",""Volcanic ash"",""Wind erosion""]",10.1016/j.aeolia.2016.01.004,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959253084,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aeolia.2016.01.004,0

The purpose of this paper is to exhibit cross-national patterns in respect of public participation, linking those differences to institutional features of the countries concerned. Design/methodology/approach – The approach is an example of case-orientated qualitative assessment of participation practices. It derives its data from the presentation of country case studies by experts on each system. The country cases are located within the historical development of democracy in each country. Findings – Patterns of participation are widely variable. Participation that is effective through routinized institutional processes appears to be inversely related to contestatory participation that uses political mobilization to challenge the legitimacy of the priority setting process. No system has resolved the conceptual ambiguities that are implicit in the idea of public participation. Originality/value – The paper draws on a unique collection of country case studies in participatory practice in prioritization, supplementing existing published sources. In showing that contestatory participation plays an important role in a sub-set of these countries it makes an important contribution to the field because it broadens the debate about public participation in priority setting beyond the use of minipublics and the observation of public representatives on decision-making bodies.","[""Community Participation"",""Cross-Over Studies"",""Decision Making"",""Health Priorities"",""Internationality"",""Qualitative Research"",""Resource Allocation""]","[""Contestatory participation"",""Cross-national comparisons"",""Priority setting"",""Public participation"",""Resource allocation""]",10.1108/JHOM-03-2016-0037,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979884765,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/79123/7/WRAP_Patterns%20of%20public_.pdf,0

Based on the municipal tree census and cuvette BVOC measurements on leaf level, we built an inventory of BVOC emissions, and assessed the potential impact of BVOCs on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in 2005 and 2010, i.e., before and after realizing the large tree-planting program for the 2008 Olympic Games. We found that sBVOCs, such as fatty acid derivatives, benzenoids, and sesquiterpenes, constituted a significant fraction (∼40) of the total annual BVOC emissions, and we estimated that the overall annual BVOC budget may have doubled from ∼4.8 × 109Cg-1 in 2005 to ∼10.3×109gC year-1 in 2010 due to the increase in urban greening, while at the same time the emission of anthropogenic VOCs (AVOCs) decreased by 24%. Based on the BVOC emission assessment, we estimated the biological impact on SOA mass formation potential in Beijing. Constitutive and stress-induced BVOCs might produce similar amounts of secondary aerosol in Beijing. However, the main contributors of SOA-mass formations originated from anthropogenic sources (>90%). This study demonstrates the general importance to include sBVOCs when studying BVOC emissions. Although the main problems regarding air quality in Beijing still originate from anthropogenic activities, the present survey suggests that in urban plantation programs, the selection of low-emitting plant species has some potential beneficial effects on urban air quality.",,,10.5194/acp-16-2901-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960517270,https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/16/2901/2016/acp-16-2901-2016.pdf,0

Published by Elsevier Ltd.A 7 story social housing apartment building in Athens, Greece has been renovated following a holistic energy efficient retrofit process. The retrofit plan, resulting from tenant surveys, environmental parameters monitoring and extensive energy simulations, included commercially available technologies like insulation and energy efficient windows, innovative technologies like energy efficient lighting and smart coatings, passive techniques like night ventilation as well as RES, aiming to transform this inefficient building into a near zero energy one, achieving a reduction of the energy consumption and CO2 emissions by 80% and significant improvement of thermal comfort conditions. An experimental campaign has been executed in order to measure and validate the energy savings and indoor comfort conditions before and after the retrofit. The results of this monitoring procedure are reported and analyzed. Measurements include air leakage and thermal imaging for determining leakage rate and heat loss through the building fabric, smart meters to record energy consumption and indoor and outdoor environmental measurements.

In this context, atmospheric moisture can potentially be harvested in the form of dew, which is commonly disregarded from the water budget, although its impact may be significant when compared to rainfall during the dry season. In this study, a dew atlas for the Mediterranean region is presented illustrating dew yields using the yield data collected for the 2013 dry season. The results indicate that cumulative monthly dew yield in the region can exceed 2.8 mm at the end of the dry season and 1.5 mm during the driest months, compared to < 1 mm of rainfall during the same period in some areas. Dew yields were compared with potential evapotranspiration (PET) and actual evapotranspiration (ET) during summer months thus highlighting the role of dew to many native plants in the region. Furthermore, forecasted trends in temperature and relative humidity were used to estimate dew yields under future climatic scenarios. The results showed a 27% decline in dew yield during the critical summer months at the end of the century (2080).","[""Actual evapotranspiration"",""Arid and semi-arid regions"",""Climate change adaptation"",""Climate change impact"",""Geostatistical analysis"",""Non-conventional water resources"",""Potential evapotranspiration"",""Temperature and relative humidity""]","[""Climate change adaptation"",""Dew"",""Geostatistical analysis"",""Non-conventional water resources""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.195,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971659881,,0

Meso-scale composition and distribution of arborescent palms in an Amazonian sustainable-use forest,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V.Arborescent palms can provide an important source of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) within tropical forest REDD+ frameworks. To identify the NTFP potential of arborescent palms, we examined meso-scale patterns of abundance and distribution within a sustainable-use protected area in the eastern Brazilian Amazon. To understand the environmental correlates of observed patterns we evaluated the effects of topography, hydrography and geographic space on the presence, density and biomass of adult arborescent palms. Adult palms were sampled in 30 (250 × 20 m) plots systematically distributed within a 25-km2 grid. Topographic and hydrographic variables were derived from a remotely sensed digital elevation model. Spatial correlations in the explanatory and response variables were examined using Mantel tests and GLMs. To test for evidence of dispersal limitation, semi-variograms were used to examine spatial patterns in GLM residuals. Adult arborescent palms were rare occurring in only 12 of the 30 plots. In total, we recorded 118 individuals from six species (Bactris maraja, Euterpe oleracea, Iriartella setigera, Oenocarpus bacaba, Oenocarpus bataua and Oenocarpus minor). This corresponded to a mean live aboveground biomass per plot of 0.85 Mg ha−1 (range: 0–28.1 Mg ha−1). Hydrographic and topographic variables suggest that environmental conditions are suitable for E. oleracea, an economically important species. The presence, biomass, and density of palms were uncorrelated with geographic distances among plots. The hydrographic model significantly explained variation in palm presence and biomass, whereas density was only explained by the topographic model. Our findings indicate that arborescent palms are currently too rare to be efficiently harvested as NTFPs in the study area. Yet, comparisons with published estimates suggest that there is significant potential for agroforestry to facilitate the commercialization of palm NTFPs for community based extractive activities.","[""Arecaceae"",""Arecoideae"",""Canopy palm"",""Meso scale"",""Palm community""]","[""Arecaceae"",""Arecoideae"",""Biomass"",""Canopy palm"",""Meso-scale distribution"",""Palm community""]",10.1016/j.foreco.2016.07.008,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978924304,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/60921/1/Accepted_manuscript.pdf,0

Predicted water scarcity will be critical in the coastal Mediterranean region, especially for provision to mid-sized and large-sized cities. This paper studies the case of the city of Tarragona, located at the Mediterranean area of north-eastern Spain (Catalonia). Several scenarios have been constructed to evaluate different sectorial water allocation policies to mitigate the water scarcity induced by global change. Future water supply and demand predictions have been made for three time spans. The decision support system presented is based on the outranking model, which constructs a partial pre-order based on pairwise preference relations among all the possible actions. The system analyses a hierarchical structure of criteria, including environmental and economic criteria. We compare several adaptation measures including alternative water sources, inter-basin water transfer and sectorial demand management coming from industry, agriculture and domestic sectors.

Focusing on birds and bees in Sichuan Province, we find that GFGP reforestation results in modest gains (via mixed forest) and losses (via monocultures) of bird diversity, along with major losses of bee diversity. Moreover, all current modes of GFGP reforestation fall short of restoring biodiversity to levels approximating native forests. However, even within existing modes of reforestation, GFGP can achieve greater biodiversity gains by promoting mixed forests over monocultures; doing so is unlikely to entail major opportunity costs or pose unforeseen economic risks to households.","[""Animals"",""Bees"",""Biodiversity"",""Birds"",""China"",""Environmental Restoration and Remediation"",""Forests""]",,10.1038/ncomms12717,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84986300445,https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12717,0

Although the cereal supply chain is an asset to the country's economy and employment, it is at the same time responsible for a number of pressures on the local and global environment including greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions and stresses on water quality and quantity. This article aims at evaluating this situation from an environmental point of view by linking production occurring in French regions with consumption occurring in France and abroad. Based on previous work on material flow analysis, we use an absorbing Markov chain model to study the fate of French cereals and link worldwide consumption to environmental pressures along the supply chain, that is, induced by production, transformation, or transport. The model is based on physical supply and use tables and distinguishes between 21 industries, 22 products, 38 regions of various spatial resolution (22 French regions, ten countries, six continents), and four modes of transport. Energy use, GHG emissions, land use, use of pesticides, and blue water footprint are studied. Illustrative examples are given in order to demonstrate the versatility of the results produced, for instance: Where and in what form does local production end up? How do regions compare relative to their production and consumption footprints?

Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (beam trawl, otter trawl, industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the beam and otter trawl fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing beam trawl effort led to greater increases in beam trawl yield when otter trawl effort was low. If otter trawl effort was high, increases in beam trawl effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, state of stocks and state of the environment.",,"[""Fisheries"",""Indicator"",""LFI"",""Mixed"",""Multispecies"",""North Sea"",""Risk"",""Trade-off"",""Uncertainty""]",10.1093/icesjms/fsw028,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978967812,https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article-pdf/73/6/1503/31231239/fsw028.pdf,0

This paper focuses on one particular resource of utmost necessity and vulnerability to climate change: namely, the provisioning of safe drinking water. From a critical perspective on the role of expertise in risk debates, this paper looks at how Swedish experts understand risk to drinking water in a climate change scenario and how they reason about challenges to risk management and adaptation strategies. The empirical material derives from ten in-depth semi-structured interviews with experts, employed both at government agencies and at universities, and with disciplinary backgrounds in a variety of fields (water engineering, planning, geology and environmental chemistry). The experts understand risk factors affecting both drinking water quality and availability as complex and systemically interrelated. A lack of political saliency of drinking water as a public service is identified as an obstacle to the development of robust adaptation strategies. Another area of concern relates to the geographical, organizational and institutional boundaries (regulatory, political and epistemological) between the plethora of public actors with partly overlapping and sometimes unclear responsibilities for the provisioning of safe drinking water. The study concludes that climate change adaptation regarding drinking water provisioning will require a new integration of the knowledge of systemic risk relations, in combination with more efficient agency collaboration based on a clear demarcation of responsibility between actors.",,"[""Adaptation"",""Climate change"",""Drinking water"",""Expertise"",""Risk management""]",10.1016/j.crm.2017.01.003,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85011573527,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.crm.2017.01.003,0

Yet, while greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit of agricultural product have been reduced at a global level, trends in world regions have been quantified less thoroughly. The KPI (Kaya-Porter Identity) is a novel framework for analysing trends in agricultural production and land-use change and related GHG emissions. We apply this to assess trends and differences in nine world regions over the period 1970-2007. We use a deconstructed analysis of emissions from the mix of multiple sources, and show how each is changing in terms of absolute emissions on a per area and per produced unit basis, and how the change of emissions from each source contributes to the change in total emissions over time. The doubling of global agricultural production has mainly been delivered by developing and transitional countries, and this has been mirrored by increased GHG emissions. The decoupling of emissions from production shows vast regional differences. Our estimates show that emissions per unit crop (as kg CO2-equivalents per Giga Joule crop product), in Oceania, have been reduced by 94% from 1093 to 69; in Central & South America by 57% from 849 to 362; in sub-Saharan Africa by 27% from 421 to 309, and in Europe by 56% from 86 to 38.

We investigated possible solutions to minimise loss of functional diversity: retaining forest fragments to enhance functional diversity within agricultural lands, and restricting future expansion of tropical crops to degraded lands or low-productivity farmlands to conserve functional diversity at a landscape level. We focused on birds, which play key functional roles and have well-known functional ecology, and oil palm, a rapidly expanding tropical crop. We did so in the Colombian Llanos, a region highlighted for the planting of sustainable oil palm, where plantations are currently replacing two main habitat types: forest remnants and improved cattle pasture. We found that levels of functional diversity (FD) and richness (FRic) were highest in remnant forests. Furthermore, levels of functional diversity and richness in oil palm and improved pasture were positively related to the proportion of forest in a 250 m radius surrounding each sample point. Frugivorous and canopy foraging species were particularly associated with remnant forests, while aquatic and terrestrial foragers were associated with pasture. This suggests that retaining forest remnants in agricultural landscapes is important in preventing large losses of functional diversity, and might also play a role in maintaining avifaunal functional richness within farmland.",,"[""Birds"",""Functional diversity"",""Landscape configuration"",""Oil palm"",""Tropical agriculture expansion""]",10.1016/j.biocon.2016.02.013,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960957838,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/58603/1/manuscript_avian_functional_diversity_7dec2015_final.docx,0

During the disease course, glioblastoma patients may experience progressive neurological deficits, symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as drowsiness and headache, incontinence, seizures and progressive cognitive dysfunction. These patients not only have cancer, but also a progressive brain disease. This may seriously interfere with their ability to make their own decisions regarding treatment. It is therefore warranted to involve glioblastoma patients early in the disease trajectory in treatment decision-making on their future care, including the end of life (EOL) care, which can be achieved with Advance Care Planning (ACP). Although ACP, by definition, aims at timely involvement of patients and proxies in decision-making on future care, the optimal moment to initiate ACP discussions in the disease trajectory of glioblastoma patients remains controversial. Moreover, the disease-specific content of these ACP discussions needs to be established.

However, cultivating purposeful collective action is challenging in ambiguous and contested situations involving multiple issues, actors, levels, and drivers, and weak or missing feedback. A particular example is the problem of managing waterway health in large and diverse landscapes. This paper analyses the emergence of purposeful collective action for managing waterway health, focusing on a case study of a large and diverse region in Australia. It applies a heuristic developed to guide inquiry into ‘enabling capacities’ underpinning purposeful collective action, to analyse three local cases embedded within a broader regional landscape. A diverse range of enabling capacities at both local and regional levels, and cross-level interplay between these levels, are shown to be important. Findings imply that efforts to generate purposeful collective action require building enabling capacities across multiple levels of organisation, from which contextually-appropriate and adaptive action can emerge. Moreover, findings indicate the need for a practice-focused ‘knowledge-action perspective’ that recognises the importance of intersubjectivity and agency.

Findings – In order to be effective in combating corruption, a fit is needed with the main determinants of corrupt behaviour: first, at the individual level in which either personal morality, social or economic considerations are at stake; second, at the organizational level in which social-psychological factors might be determinative; and third, at the contextual level in which economic prosperity, the nature of the political system and cultural features are important. Practical implications – Especially in systems where corruption is widespread, policymakers could benefit from theories in social psychology to combat corruption. Social implications – To see corruption as the result of an individual cost-benefit analysis or as a lack of morality often misses the point in cases of widespread corruption. Originality/value – The paper points at the added value of social psychology approach to corruption as compared to the approaches at present dominant in public administration.",,"[""Corruption"",""Costs"",""Human resources management"",""Transparency""]",10.1108/IJPSM-11-2015-0197,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962161386,,0

OBJECTIVE To review the legal status of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide and the available data on attitudes and practices. EVIDENCE REVIEW Polling data and published surveys of the public and physicians, official state and country databases, interview studies with physicians, and death certificate studies (the Netherlands and Belgium) were reviewed for the period 1947 to 2016. FINDINGS Currently, euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide can be legally practiced in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Colombia, and Canada (Quebec since 2014, nationally as of June 2016). Physician-assisted suicide, excluding euthanasia, is legal in 5 US states (Oregon,Washington, Montana, Vermont, and California) and Switzerland. Public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide in the United States has plateaued since the 1990s (range, 47%-69%). InWestern Europe, an increasing and strong public support for euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide has been reported; in Central and Eastern Europe, support is decreasing. In the United States, less than 20%of physicians report having received requests for euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide, and 5%or less have complied. In Oregon andWashington state, less than 1% of licensed physicians write prescriptions for physician-assisted suicide per year. In the Netherlands and Belgium, about half or more of physicians reported ever having received a request; 60% of Dutch physicians have ever granted such requests. Between 0.3%to 4.6%of all deaths are reported as euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide in jurisdictions where they are legal. The frequency of these deaths increased after legalization. More than 70%of cases involved patients with cancer. Typical patients are older, white, and well-educated. Pain is mostly not reported as the primary motivation. A large portion of patients receiving physician-assisted suicide in Oregon and Washington reported being enrolled in hospice or palliative care, as did patients in Belgium. In no jurisdiction was there evidence that vulnerable patients have been receiving euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide at rates higher than those in the general population. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide are increasingly being legalized, remain relatively rare, and primarily involve patients with cancer. Existing data do not indicate widespread abuse of these practices.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Attitude of Health Personnel"",""Canada"",""Colombia"",""Europe"",""Euthanasia"",""Humans"",""Middle Aged"",""Neoplasms"",""Practice Guidelines as Topic"",""Public Opinion"",""Suicide, Assisted"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Terminology as Topic"",""United States"",""Withholding Treatment"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1001/jama.2016.8499,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977507826,,0

Using microreactor technology, the reaction could be optimized under dilute conditions with low material burden and the kinetic parameters investigated. For larger lab-scale operation (gram scale), process-relevant concentrations could be employed and the conditions developed for continuous workup effectively demonstrated (batch methodology published concurrently). The stability of the NHC catalyst allowed for a continuous acidic extraction of the product and on-stream recycling of the catalyst in the organic phase. At this scale, sonication is employed to prevent clogging in the reactor unit. Finally, a bespoke continuous flow reactor has been developed for carrying out the reaction beyond lab scale. This novel reactor concept for running heterogeneous reactions in flow combines the flexibility of continuously stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) with the smooth operation, low residence time distribution and excellent heat transfer capability of a conventional flow reactor. A LCA (life cycle analysis) study has been carried out on the resulting process in comparison with the existing batch protocol, revealing it to be favorable under the majority of environmental factors considered.","[""Continuous flow reactors"",""Continuously stirred tank reactor"",""Environmental factors"",""Heat transfer capability"",""Heterogeneous reactions"",""Microreactor technology"",""N-heterocyclic carbenes"",""Pharmaceutical intermediates""]",,10.1021/acs.oprd.5b00350,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975698666,,0

Mortality associated with surgery for phaeochromocytoma has dramatically decreased over the last decades. Many factors contributed to the dramatic decline of the mortality rate, and the influence of an α-receptor blockade is unclear and has never been tested in a randomized trial. We evaluated intraoperative haemodynamic conditions and the incidence of complications in patients with and without α-receptor blockade undergoing surgery for catecholamine producing tumours. Methods. Haemodynamic conditions and perioperative complications were assessed in 110 patients with (B) and 166 without (N) α-receptor blockade. Data were analysed as a consecutive case series of 303 cases and subsequently via propensity score matching, and presented as mean and confidence interval (CI). Results. No difference in maximal intraoperative systolic arterial pressures (B = 178 mm Hg (CI 169-187) vs N = 185 mm Hg (CI 177-193; P = 0.2542) and hypertensive episodes above 250 mm Hg were found (P = 0.7474) for the closed case series. No major complications occurred. Propensity score matching (75 pairs) revealed a significant difference of 17 mm Hg in maximal intraoperative systolic bp for these selected pairs (P = 0.024). Conclusions. Only a slight difference in mean maximal systolic arterial pressure was detected between patients with or without an α-receptor blockade. There was no difference in the incidence of excessive hypertensive episodes between groups and no major complications occurred. The basis for the general recommendation of perioperative α-receptor blockade for phaeochromocytoma surgery demands further study.","[""Adolescent"",""Adrenal Gland Neoplasms"",""Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Female"",""Hemodynamics"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Pheochromocytoma"",""Propensity Score"",""Young Adult""]","[""Doxazosin"",""Paraganglioma"",""Phaeochromocytoma"",""Phenoxybenzamine""]",10.1093/bja/aew392,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020767520,http://bjanaesthesia.org/article/S0007091217300788/pdf,0

It explores the educational ideas began in childhood with the realisation that self-induced learning would be more productive and satisfying than teachers' teaching. Comprehensive education and equality of opportunity were the banners under teaching with a mission. The chapter argues that the kind of continuous self-education advocated by Maslow is especially necessary in the light of contemporary adverse conditions affecting the teaching profession across the world. Maslow had articulated the idea of self-actualisation and made it well known among psychologists in the West. The consequence of the present condition have coincided with movements among curriculum policy makers and reformers as far afield as Hong Kong, Australia, Namibia, and England at least in the rhetoric of school based curriculum development, teacher self-actualisation, and teaching as a research-based profession.",,,10.4324/9781315254159-11,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85082886772,,0

However, new interferon-free regimens containing direct-acting antiviral agents have fewer adverse effects and better effectiveness, making HCV treatment feasible early after transplant. In 2014, we successfully used sofosbuvir and ribavirin to treat a patient with HCV genotype 3 cirrhosis who was listed for liver transplantation. Because the patient's hepatocellular carcinoma score was outside the Milan criteria, an allograft from a donor with HCV genotype 3 was accepted as rescue treatment. Patient characteristics, laboratory results, and the course of disease and treatment were documented from March 2014 to May 2015. HCV reinfection was successfully treated with sofosbuvir and ribavirin early after transplant, with no adverse effects. Viral load was below detectable levels 4 weeks after start of treatment. Liver values returned to normal, and the FibroScan score improved. Sustained virologic response was documented 12 weeks after treatment. With interferon-free regimens for HCV infection, expanding the donor pool by including HCV-positive organs is an interesting option that could substantially decrease waiting times and mortality rates for patients listed for transplant. This review comprehends and discusses available data, challenges and chances for using HCV-positive donor organs in the advent of new HCV therapeutic options.","[""Antiviral Agents"",""Carcinoma, Hepatocellular"",""Genotype"",""Hepacivirus"",""Hepatitis C"",""Humans"",""Liver Neoplasms"",""Liver Transplantation"",""Recurrence"",""Ribavirin"",""RNA, Viral"",""Sofosbuvir"",""Tissue Donors"",""Viral Load""]","[""Hepacivirus"",""Liver transplantation"",""Sofosbuvir""]",10.23736/S1121-421X.16.02347-3,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85012930625,,0

From a scrutiny of legislative provisions, court judgments, government documents and a public opinion survey on child placement options, the paper draws out similarities and differences in understandings of the place of 'permanence' within the child welfare discourse in Norway and England. The main differences are that in England the components of permanence are explicitly set out in legislation, statutory guidance and advisory documents whilst in Norway the terms 'stability' and 'continuity' are used in a more limited number of policy documents in the context of a wide array of services available for children and families. The paper then draws on these sources, and on administrative data on children in care, to tease out possible explanations for the similarities and differences identified. We hypothesise that both long-standing policies and recent changes can be explained by differences in public and political understandings of child welfare and the balance between universal services and those targeted on parents and children identified as vulnerable and in need of specialist services.",,"[""Care orders"",""Child protection"",""England"",""Norway"",""Permanence"",""Policy""]",10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.05.020,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973464807,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.childyouth.2016.05.020,0

However, the genetic characteristics of the transmitted viruses that are preferentially selected have not been fully elucidated. Here, we analyzed amino acids changes in the envelope protein during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/HIV deep transmission history and current HIV evolution within the last 15–20 years. Our results confirmed that the V1V2 region of gp120 protein, particularly V1, was preferentially selected. A shorter V1 region was preferred during transmission history, while during epidemic, HIV may evolve to an expanded V1 region gradually and thus escape immune recognition. We then constructed different HIV-1 V1 mutants using different HIV-1 subtypes to elucidate the role of the V1 region in envelope function. We found that the V1 region, although highly variable, was indispensable for virus entry and infection, probably because V1 deletion mutants exhibited impaired processing of gp160 into mature gp120 and gp41. Additionally, the V1 region affected Env incorporation. These results indicated that the V1 region played a critical role in HIV transmission and infection.

However, it remains unclear how such challenges elicit positive innovation performance. Moreover, we still cannot distinguish between the conditions under which challenges enhance or hinder firm innovation performance. In this paper, we review the literature on coping with a specific and central type of challenge - resource challenge, such as a lack of financial or human resources - and propose an underlying mechanism through which firms can benefit from resource challenges. The paper presents an integrative conceptual framework and looks at the key constructs that explain the effects of resource challenges on firm innovation performance.

All rights reserved.Recurrent crises in emerging markets and in advanced economies in the last decades cast doubt about the ability of financial liberalization to meet the aims of sustainable economic growth and development. The increasing importance of financial markets and financial efficiency criterion over economic decisions and policies since the 1980s laid down the conditions of the development process of emerging market economies. Numerous crises experienced thereafter gave rise to flourishing work on the links between financialization and economic development. Several decades of observations and lessons can now be integrated into economic and econometric models to give more sophisticated and multivariable approaches to financial development with respect to growth and development issues. In the markets-based and private-enterprise dominated world economy, two conditions for a successful growth-enhancing financial evolution can at least be brought fore: macroeconomic stability and consistent supervision. But even after the 2007-2008 global crisis, economists do not agree on the meaning of those conditions. For liberal and equilibrium-market economists, good finance and supervision mean market-friendly structures while for institutionalists, post-Keynesian and Marxist economists, good finance and supervision must lie in collectively designed and managed public structures. Drawing heavily on the tumultuous crises of the 1990s-2000s, this book argues that those experiences can shed light on such a crucial issue and lead economic theory and policy to go beyond the blindness of efficient free markets doctrine to economic catastrophes. It also points to new challenges to global stability in the wake of reconfiguration of international financial arena under the weight of major emerging market economies.",,,10.4324/9781315648644,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85026480668,,0

In particular, perinatal remains are one of the best indicators of breeding practices at archaeological sites. Nevertheless, remains from this age group, and especially fetal remains, have been largely ignored in archaeozoological studies. In the Neolithic (6th–4th millennium cal.

Due to this relative abundance at El Mirador, we studied the remains of animals from this age group, distinguishing fetal remains from neonatal remains by means of anatomical and metric criteria. We found that in El Mirador cave fetal and neonatal remains were present on most levels. The fetal remains exhibit mortality ratios similar to current-day sheep flocks.

Here, we use the isotope composition of tooth enamel to investigate the diet and habitat of bovids, cervids, and suids from several Holocene and Pleistocene sites on Java and Sumatra. Our carbon isotope results indicate that individual sites are strongly dominated by either C3-browsers or C4-grazers. Herbivores from the Padang Highlands (Sumatra) and Hoekgrot (Java) cave faunas were mainly C3-browsers, while herbivores from Homo erectus-bearing sites Trinil and Sangiran (Java) utilized an almost exclusive C4 diet. The suids from all sites show a wide range of δ13C values, corroborating their omnivorous diet. For the dataset as a whole, oxygen and carbon isotope values are positively correlated. This suggests that isotopic enrichment of rainwater and vegetation δ18O values coincides with an increase of C4-grasslands. We interpret this pattern to mainly reflect the environmental contrast between glacial (drier, more C4) and interglacial (wetter, more C3) conditions. Intermediate herbivore δ13C values indicating mixed C3/C4 feeding is relatively rare, which we believe to reflect the abruptness of the transition between glacial and interglacial precipitation regimes in Sundaland. For seven Homo erectus bone samples we were not able distinguish between diagenetic overprint and original isotope values, underlining the need to apply this isotopic approach to Homo erectus tooth enamel instead of bone. Importantly, our present results on herbivore and omnivore faunas provide the isotopic framework that will allow interpretation of such Homo erectus enamel isotope data.","[""Homo erectus"",""Paleoclimates"",""Sangiran"",""Sundaland"",""Trinil""]","[""C3"",""C4"",""Diet"",""Homo erectus"",""Paleoclimate"",""Sangiran"",""Sea-level"",""Sundaland"",""Trinil"",""Vegetation""]",10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.02.028,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971219363,,0

This study provides an assessment of Dutch EMF information needs from an ensemble of sources by addressing peoples existing ideas and beliefs, using a mental models approach. A summary expert model of influences on and consequences of exposure derived from search of the relevant literature is informed by interviews with 15 scientists and professionals with diverse expertise. Although the professionals characterize the physical characteristics and psychological aspects of exposure to EMF in daily life similarly, there is no consensus regarding potential health effects. Interviews with 12 lay people followed by a confirmatory survey of the general Dutch public (n = 403) reveal not only wide variation in beliefs regarding potential health effects of EMF, but also overestimation of the amount of radiation from public sources relative to personal sources of EMF. People do not feel adequately informed by the government about EMF, and knowledge of government policies on EMF is limited. Together, the evidence suggests three focal points for improving EMF risk communications: providing more clarity regarding the uncertainty of evidence for health effects, illuminating personal EMF exposures in daily life and providing more accessible and transparent information on governmental policies.","[""Governmental policies"",""Mental model"",""Physical characteristics"",""Potential health"",""Potential health risks"",""Precautionary policies"",""Psychological Aspects"",""Risk communication""]","[""electromagnetic fields"",""mental models"",""risk communication""]",10.1080/13669877.2014.961519,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84911489324,,0

The unprecedented scale and mechanization of the war changed forever the way suffering and dying were perceived and challenged notions of what the nations could reasonably expect of their military. Examining experiences of the Western Front, this book looks at the life of a soldier from the moment he marched into battle until he was buried. In five chapters - Battle, Body, Mind, Aid, Death - it describes and analyzes the physical and mental hardship of the men who fought on a front that stretched from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border. Beginning with a broad description of the war it then analyzes the medical aid the Tommies, Bonhommes and Frontschweine received - or all too often did not receive - revealing how this aid was often given for military and political rather than humanitarian reasons (getting the men back to the front or munitions factory and trying to spare the state as many war-pensions as possible). It concludes with a chapter on the many ways death presented itself on or around the battlefield, and sets out in detail the problems that arise when more people are killed than can possibly be buried properly. In contrast to most books in the field this study does not focus on one single issue - such as venereal disease, plastic surgery, shell-shock or the military medical service - but takes a broad view on wounds and illnesses across both sides of the conflict.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus. All rights reserved.This study was designed as an external evaluation of the Steyerberg score in the prediction of different categories of postoperative mortality after esophagectomy on a large nationwide database of thoracic surgeons. Data collection was obtained from the Epithor national database encompassing the majority of thoracic procedures performed in France. We retrospectively compared the predicted to the observed postoperative 30-day (30DM), 90-day (90DM) and in-hospital mortality (IHM) rate in each decile of equal patient. Patients included in the study were operated for an esophageal cancer and Gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Steyerberg score was determined according to its logarithmic formula obtained from a sum score including age, comorbidities, neoadjuvant treatment and hospital volume. Deviation of observed from theoretically expected number of deaths was investigated using the calibration test of Hosmer-Lemeshow. Discrimination of the score was determined using the measure of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of each category of mortality. Over a 9-year period, 1039 consecutive patients underwent an esophagectomy over 42 centers. Among them, 18 centers were considered as intermediate or high-volume institutions, and 24 were low-volume institutions. There were 841 males (81%) with a mean age of 62.3 ± 10 years. Preoperative treatment was allocated to 420 patients (40%). Numbers of comorbidity was: 1 in 261 patients (25%), 2 in 264 patients (25%), 3 in 383 patients (36%) and 4 in 5 patients (1%). The 30DM, 90DM and IHM rate were, respectively, 5.6%, 9.2% and 9.6%. The main causes of postoperative deaths were related to pulmonary complications (44%), complications of the gastric interposition (28%), cardiologic and thromboembolism events (10%). For 30DM, there were significant differences between predicted/observed mortalities in four deciles, whereas there was no significant difference for 90DM and for IHM. In term of calibration, there was a fair agreement of the Steyerberg score with observed 30DM. Predictions were above 20% for seven deciles. Calibration seemed more adequate for 90DM and for IHM. Predictions were above 20% for only three deciles but deviations were not significant. In terms of discrimination, for the 30DM the Steyerberg score overpredicted, the observed mortality rate and AUC was 0.64 (CI 95%: 0.57-0.71). For the 90DM, AUC indicated 0.63 (CI 95%: 0.57-0.68). For the IHM, AUC indicated 0.63 (CI 95%: 0.58-0.68). Steyerberg scoring system seems to be a moderate risk score of the prediction of the IHM and 90DM. This score appears to have a fair discrimination for the 30DM. Nevertheless, because of its simplicity, we believe that this simple predictive score is relevant and transportable to others institution performing such surgery for benchmarking purposes. A reappraisal of the score adapted to current surgical cohort is required.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Area Under Curve"",""Chemoradiotherapy"",""Comorbidity"",""Databases, Factual"",""Esophageal Neoplasms"",""Esophagectomy"",""Female"",""France"",""Hospital Mortality"",""Hospitals, High-Volume"",""Hospitals, Low-Volume"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Mortality"",""Neoadjuvant Therapy"",""Postoperative Period"",""Radiotherapy"",""Reproducibility of Results"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Assessment""]","[""Esophageal cancer"",""Esophagectomy"",""Hospital-volume"",""Mortality"",""Prediction""]",10.1111/dote.12447,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954494622,,0

In the coming years farmers are required to pursue these goals with more determination and further improvements are expected in the greening process (focusing on ecological effects) and sustainability (combining both ecological, economical and social objectives). Re-engineering the production techniques and using new materials could play an important role in order to significantly improve the environmental profile of food products. These changes (incremental innovations) can make improvements to performances and characteristics of an existing product (product upgrading), but unfotunately, they have usually a higher level of costs. This study aims to develop an integrated methodology by capitalizing the complementary strengths of different methods in a system perspective, and holistic approach for innovation assessment. The framework adopts life cycle thinking method (Life Cycle Assessment) and Cost-Benefit Analysis framework. The need for integrated methodological framework for innovation assessment is due to increasingly complex environmental system problems.The framework is being applied to assessment of an incremental innovation (biodegradable mulch film) in intensive cultivation of four crops grown in cold greenhouse.

However, functional tests measuring the negative feedback of the HPA axis cannot easily be implemented into large observational studies. Furthermore, high doses of dexamethasone often completely suppress the HPA axis in healthy persons. This study aimed to detect the effects of the health, lifestyle and sociodemographic factors, psychiatric problems and cognitive functions on the negative feedback of the HPA axis using a very low-dose (0.25 mg) dexamethasone suppression test (DST). We evaluated the associations of several determinants with the saliva cortisol concentrations after dexamethasone intake in a confounder-adjusted model also corrected for baseline saliva cortisol concentrations in the Rotterdam Study, a large population-based study (N = 1822). We found that female sex, low income, lack of exercise, instrumental disability and smoking were all independently associated with stronger suppression of the HPA axis. Even though there were no linear associations between psychiatric measures and cortisol suppression, we found that depressive symptoms and anxiety disorders were more common in persons with non-suppression of cortisol. Conversely, psychotropic medication use was related to enhanced suppression of cortisol after DST. In this large study, we found that female gender, low socioeconomic status and poor health were all related to suppression of the HPA axis. Non-linear associations were detected between the suppression of the HPA axis and common psychiatric disorders in community-dwelling persons.","[""Anxiety Disorders"",""Cross-Sectional Studies"",""Depression"",""Dexamethasone"",""Feedback, Physiological"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Hydrocortisone"",""Male"",""Mass Screening"",""Middle Aged"",""Pituitary-Adrenal System"",""Risk Factors"",""Saliva""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0164348,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992061382,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0164348&type=printable,0

We do so by discussing propositions generated by human capital theory and apply them to the experiences of students and graduates from Colombian universities. We conducted a survey (n = 700) amongst graduate and undergraduate students at 12 low-fee private universities. Four interviews with (former) students served as an illustration. The majority of undergraduate students perceived the quality of their education as poor and wanted to attend another university. Both students and graduates expressed uncertainty about finding a job and anticipated difficulties as they felt they lacked essential skills. Due to relatively unhindered privatization and marketization of the columbian higher education sector, low-quality private provision in Colombia demonstrates this structural inequality. Our study shows that investing in higher education does not always correlate positively with skills gained or future income, thereby revealing the necessity to use human capital theory in a more nuanced manner.",,"[""Colombia"",""Higher education"",""Human capital"",""Private education""]",10.1177/1478210316639416,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84986216988,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1478210316639416,0

Education Against Tobacco (EAT) is a multinational network of medical students who volunteer for school-based prevention in the classroom setting, amongst other activities. EAT has been implemented in 28 medical schools in Germany and is present in 13 additional countries around the globe. A recent quasi-experimental study showed significant short-term smoking cessation effects on 11-to-15-year-old adolescents. Objective: The aim of this study was to provide the first randomized long-term evaluation of the optimized 2014 EAT curriculum involving a photoaging software for its effectiveness in reducing the smoking prevalence among 11-to-15-year-old pupils in German secondary schools. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken with 1504 adolescents from 9 German secondary schools, aged 11-15 years in grades 6-8, of which 718 (47.74%) were identifiable for the prospective sample at the 12-month follow-up. The experimental study design included measurements at baseline (t1), 6 months (t2), and 12 months postintervention (t3), via questionnaire. The study groups consisted of 40 randomized classes that received the standardized EAT intervention (two medical student-led interactive modules taking 120 minutes total) and 34 control classes within the same schools (no intervention). The primary endpoint was the difference in smoking prevalence from t1 to t3 in the control group versus the difference from t1 to t3 in the intervention group. The differences in smoking behavior (smoking onset, quitting) between the two groups, as well as gender-specific effects, were studied as secondary outcomes. Results: None of the effects were significant due to a high loss-to-follow-up effect (52.26%, 786/1504). From baseline to the two follow-up time points, the prevalence of smoking increased from 3.1% to 5.2% to 7.2% in the control group and from 3.0% to 5.4% to 5.8% in the intervention group (number needed to treat [NNT]=68). Notable differences were observed between the groups for the female gender (4.2% to 9.5% for control vs 4.0% to 5.2% for intervention; NNT=24 for females vs NNT=207 for males), low educational background (7.3% to 12% for control vs 6.1% to 8.7% for intervention; NNT=30), and migrational background (students who claimed that at least one parent was not born in Germany) at the 12-month follow-up. The intervention appears to prevent smoking onset (NNT=63) but does not appear to initiate quitting. Conclusions: The intervention appears to prevent smoking, especially in females and students with a low educational background.","[""Adolescent"",""Child"",""Female"",""Germany"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Prospective Studies"",""Research Design"",""School Health Services"",""Schools"",""Smoking"",""Smoking Cessation"",""Smoking Prevention"",""Students, Medical"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Tobacco""]","[""Adolescents"",""Medical students"",""School-based prevention"",""Secondary schools"",""Smoking cessation"",""Tobacco prevention""]",10.2196/jmir.7906,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021824023,https://www.jmir.org/api/download?filename=9d59033140eabfaf75789ee14459d40d.pdf&alt_name=7906-129544-2-SP.pdf,0

This is an open ccess article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Every year, the oceans absorb about 30% of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) leading to a re-equilibration of the marine carbonate system and decreasing seawater pH. Today, there is increasing awareness that these changes-summarized by the term ocean acidification (OA)-could differentially affect the competitive ability of marine organisms, thereby provoking a restructuring of marine ecosystems and biogeochemical element cycles. In winter 2013, we deployed ten pelagic mesocosms in the Gullmar Fjord at the Swedish west coast in order to study the effect of OA on plankton ecology and biogeochemistry under close to natural conditions. Five of the ten mesocosms were left unperturbed and served as controls (∼380 μatm pCO2), whereas the others were enriched with CO2-saturated water to simulate realistic end-of-the-century carbonate chemistry conditions (∼760 μatm pCO2). We ran the experiment for 113 days which allowed us to study the influence of high CO2 on an entire winter-to-summer plankton succession and to investigate the potential of some plankton organisms for evolutionary adaptation to OA in their natural environment. This paper is the first in a PLOS collection and provides a detailed overview on the experimental design, important events, and the key complexities of such a ""long-term mesocosm"" approach. Furthermore, we analyzed whether simulated end-of-the-century carbonate chemistry conditions could lead to a significant restructuring of the plankton community in the course of the succession. At the level of detail analyzed in this overview paper we found that CO2-induced differences in plankton community composition were non-detectable during most of the succession except for a period where a phytoplankton bloom was fueled by remineralized nutrients. These results indicate: (1) Long-term studies with pelagic ecosystems are necessary to uncover OA-sensitive stages of succession. (2) Plankton communities fueled by regenerated nutrients may be more responsive to changing carbonate chemistry than those having access to high inorganic nutrient concentrations and may deserve particular attention in future studies.","[""Carbon Dioxide"",""Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"",""Plankton"",""Seasons"",""Seawater""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0159068,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84985903340,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0159068&type=printable,0

A case study in unfragmented montane forests,"© 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.Understanding the processes that shape biodiversity patterns is essential for ecosystem management and conservation. Local environmental conditions are often good predictors of species distribution and variations in habitat quality usually positively correlate to species richness. However, beside habitat limitation, species presence-absence may be constrained by dispersal limitation. We tested the relative importance of both limitations on saproxylic beetle diversity, using forest continuity as a surrogate for dispersal limitation and stand maturity as a surrogate for habitat limitation. Forest continuity relies on the maintenance of a forest cover over time, while stand maturity results in the presence of old-growth habitat features. Forty montane beech-fir forests in the French pre-Alps were sampled, under a balanced sampling design in which forest continuity and stand maturity were crossed. A total of 307 saproxylic beetle species were captured using flight-interception traps and Winkler–Berlese extractors. We explored the response of low- versus high-dispersal species groups to forest continuity and stand maturity. Saproxylic beetle diversity increased significantly with stand maturity and was mostly influenced by variables related to deadwood diversity at the stand scale and suitable habitat availability at the landscape scale. Surprisingly, no evidence of dispersal limitation was found, as diversity patterns were not influenced by forest continuity and associated variables, even for low-dispersal species. Our study demonstrates that in an unfragmented forest landscape, saproxylic beetles are able to colonize recent forests, as long as local deadwood resources are sufficiently diversified (e.g. tree species, position, diameter and/or decay stage).",,"[""Biodiversity patterns"",""Forest continuity"",""Saproxylic beetles"",""Stand maturity""]",10.1007/s10531-016-1116-8,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964282797,,0

Resultados del registro Ebrictus,"© 2016 Revista de Neurología.Aim. To determine the population incidence of intracerebral haemorrhage and its preventable incidence, associated risk factors and prognosis of death and disability. Subjects and methods. We examined a sample of 240 consecutive patients with a first episode of intracerebral haemorrhage between 1st April 2006 and 30th June 2015. The main variables are: NIHSS scale, comorbidity, pharmacological information, Barthel index, Rankin scale, time within therapeutic window, prognosis and destination on hospital discharge. The ‘unnecessarily premature and sanitarily avoidable mortality’ (MIPSE) classification was applied to define the cases as ‘preventable incidence’. Results. The rate of population incidence of haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease was 23.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants/year; an exponential increase occurred from the age of 55 years in males and 75 years in females. The rate ratio was 0.682. The preventable incidence would account for 66.6% of all the cases in those under 75 years of age and 22.7% in those aged 75 or over. The chances of survival and functional autonomy were significantly lower in females, and age, anticoagulant treatment, the presence of polymedication and treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants were factors that were independent of the prognosis. Conclusions. The incidence of haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease does not appear to be modified within the period, but just the opposite occurs with the factors associated according to sex and age.

In this study, we investigated food processing of 13C and 15N labelled bacteria and algae by the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa. Coral respiration, tissue incorporation of C and N and metabolically derived C incorporation into the skeleton were traced following the additions of different food concentrations (100, 300, 1300μg CL-1) and two ratios of suspended bacterial and algal biomass (1:1, 3:1). Respiration and tissue incorporation by L. pertusa increased markedly following exposure to higher food concentrations. The net growth efficiency of L. pertusa was low (0.08±0.03), which is consistent with its slow growth rate. The contribution of algae and bacteria to total coral assimilation was proportional to the food mixture in the two lowest food concentrations, but algae were preferred over bacteria as a food source at the highest food concentration. Similarly, the stoichiometric uptake of C and N was coupled in the low and medium food treatment, but was uncoupled in the high food treatment and indicated a comparatively higher uptake or retention of bacterial carbon as compared to algal nitrogen. We argue that behavioural responses for these small-sized food particles, such as tentacle behaviour, mucus trapping and physiological processing, are more likely to explain the observed food selectivity as compared to physical-mechanical considerations. A comparison of the experimental food conditions to natural organic carbon concentrations above CWC reefs suggests that L. pertusa is well adapted to exploit temporal pulses of high organic matter concentrations in the bottom water caused by internal waves and downwelling events.",,,10.5194/bg-13-5789-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992694886,https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/5789/2016/bg-13-5789-2016.pdf,0

As preventive strategies are largely ineffective, threatened preterm labor is a frequent problem that affects approximately 10 % of pregnancies. In recent years, risk assessment in these women has incorporated cervical length measurement and fetal fibronectin testing, and this has improved the capacity to identify women at increased risk for delivery within 14 days. Despite these improvements, risk for preterm birth continues to be increased in women who did not deliver after an episode of threatened preterm labor, as indicated by a preterm birth rate between 30 to 60 % in this group of women. Currently no effective treatment is available. Studies on maintenance tocolysis and progesterone have shown ambiguous results. The pessary has not been evaluated in women with threatened preterm labor, however studies in asymptomatic women with a short cervix show reduced rates of preterm birth rates as well as perinatal complications. The APOSTEL VI trial aims to assess the effectiveness of a cervical pessary in women who did not deliver within 48 h after an episode of threatened preterm labor. Methods/Design: This is a nationwide multicenter open-label randomized clinical trial. Women with a singleton or twin gestation with intact membranes, who were admitted for threatened preterm labor, at a gestational age between 24 and 34 weeks, a cervical length between 15 and 30 mm and a positive fibronectin test or a cervical length below 15 mm, who did not deliver after 48 h will be eligible for inclusion. Women will be allocated to a pessary or no intervention (usual care). Primary outcome is preterm delivery < 37 weeks. Secondary outcomes are amongst others a composite of perinatal morbidity and mortality. Sample size is based on an expected 50 % reduction of preterm birth before 37 weeks (two-sided test, α 0.05 and β 0.2). Two hundred women with a singleton pregnancy need to be randomized. Analysis will be done by intention to treat. Discussion: The APOSTEL VI trial will provide evidence whether a pessary is effective in preventing preterm birth in women who did not deliver 48 h after admission for threatened preterm labor and who remain at high risk for preterm birth.

All Rights Reserved.Methanobactins (mbs) are low-molecular-mass (<1,200 Da) copper-binding peptides, or chalkophores, produced by many methane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs). These molecules exhibit similarities to certain iron-binding siderophores but are expressed and secreted in response to copper limitation. Structurally, mbs are characterized by a pair of heterocyclic rings with associated thioamide groups that form the copper coordination site. One of the rings is always an oxazolone and the second ring an oxazolone, an imidazolone, or a pyrazinedione moiety. The mb molecule originates from a peptide precursor that undergoes a series of posttranslational modifications, including (i) ring formation, (ii) cleavage of a leader peptide sequence, and (iii) in some cases, addition of a sulfate group. Functionally, mbs represent the extracellular component of a copper acquisition system. Consistent with this role in copper acquisition, mbs have a high affinity for copper ions. Following binding, mbs rapidly reduce Cu2+ to Cu1+. In addition to binding copper, mbs will bind most transition metals and near-transition metals and protect the host methanotroph as well as other bacteria from toxic metals. Several other physiological functions have been assigned to mbs, based primarily on their redox and metal-binding properties. In this review, we examine the current state of knowledge of this novel type of metal-binding peptide. We also explore its potential applications, how mbs may alter the bioavailability of multiple metals, and the many roles mbs may play in the physiology of methanotrophs.","[""Amino Acid Sequence"",""Bacterial Proteins"",""Binding Sites"",""Biodegradation, Environmental"",""Coordination Complexes"",""Copper"",""Gene Expression"",""Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial"",""Imidazoles"",""Metabolic Networks and Pathways"",""Methane"",""Methylococcaceae"",""Oligopeptides"",""Oxidation-Reduction"",""Protein Binding"",""Soil Pollutants""]",,10.1128/MMBR.00058-15,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84973293668,https://mmbr.asm.org/content/mmbr/80/2/387.full.pdf,0

Compiling estimates from different sources, and considering recent technological advances in deep mining suggests that the Ultimately Recoverable Resource (URR) is about 216,000 ton of platinum group metals down to a mining depth of maximum 5 km, significantly more than earlier published estimates. The world supply and production of platinum group metals was calculated using system dynamics methodology to develop the PGM-model for this study. The model combines mining, ore grade changes, trade markets, price mechanisms, supply, demand, estimates of stock-in-use, waste, dissipative losses and recycling into a whole world system. The model was run for the period of 1900–2400. The model outputs were successfully tested on historic data for mining rate, ore grades and platinum market price during 1900–2014. The model indicates that extraction will reach maximum in the period 2020–2050 and that market supply will peak in 2070–2080. The delay is caused by the effect of recycling. The outputs from the model emphasize the importance of recycling, metal conservation and elimination of dissipative losses in order to secure long term sustainable platinum group metals supply.","[""Dissipative loss"",""Long-term development"",""Platinum group metals"",""Recoverable resource"",""Scarcity"",""System dynamics model"",""System dynamics modelling"",""Technological advances""]","[""Market"",""Mining"",""Modelling"",""PGM"",""Recycling"",""Scarcity""]",10.1016/j.resconrec.2016.07.011,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982683389,,0

Published.Anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria derive their energy for growth from the oxidation of ammonium with nitrite as the electron acceptor. N2 , the end product of this metabolism, is produced from the oxidation of the intermediate, hydrazine (N2 H4 ). Previously, we identified N2 -producing hydrazine dehydrogenase (KsHDH) from the anammox organism Kuenenia stuttgartiensis as the gene product of kustc0694 and determined some of its catalytic properties. In the genome of K. stuttgartiensis, kustc0694 is one of 10 paralogs related to octaheme hydroxylamine (NH2OH) oxidoreductase (HAO). Here, we characterized KsHDH as a covalently cross-linked homotrimeric octaheme protein as found for HAO and HAO-related hydroxylamine-oxidizing enzyme kustc1061 from K. stuttgartiensis. Interestingly, the HDH trimers formed octamers in solution, each octamer harboring an amazing 192 c-type heme moieties. Whereas HAO and kustc1061 are capable of hydrazine oxidation as well, KsHDH was highly specific for this activity. To understand this specificity, we performed detailed amino acid sequence analyses and investigated the catalytic and spectroscopic (electronic absorbance, EPR) properties of KsHDH in comparison with the well defined HAO and kustc1061. We conclude that HDH specificity is most likely derived from structural changes around the catalytic heme 4 (P460 ) and of the electron-wiring circuit comprising seven His/His-ligated c-type hemes in each subunit. These nuances make HDH a globally prominent N2-producing enzyme, next to nitrous oxide (N2O) reductase from denitrifying microorganisms.","[""Amino acid sequence analysis"",""Catalytic properties"",""Covalently cross-linked"",""Denitrifying microorganisms"",""Electron acceptor"",""Hydrazine oxidation"",""Nitrogen cycles"",""Oxidoreductases"",""Ammonium Compounds"",""Bacterial Proteins"",""Catalysis"",""Hydrazines"",""Nitrogen"",""Oxidation-Reduction"",""Oxidoreductases"",""Planctomycetales""]",,10.1074/jbc.M116.735530,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979896716,http://www.jbc.org/content/291/33/17077.full.pdf,0

Three conventional sludge has been tested in sequencing batch reactor for Anammox enrichment, including conventional aerobic sludge, denitrification sludge, and anaerobic sludge. With a high selection stress and insufficient oxygen control, the reactor seeded with aerobic sludge reached 50–60% total nitrogen removal after 240 days whereas that seeded with anaerobic sludge failed to establish Anammox activity. Anammox process was successfully established in the reactor seeded with denitrification sludge with a total nitrogen removal of approximately 80% after 150 days under strict oxygen control (DO <0.2 mg/L) and low selection stress. Under the same operational condition, the reactor seeded with anaerobic sludge reached only 20–30% total nitrogen removal. All the reactors experienced fluctuating performances during the enrichment process, which was believed to be the consequence of inhibitory factors such as dissolved oxygen, nitrite and free ammonia as well as undesirable coexisting bacteria which compete for the same substrate.

Current forestry policy advocates a diversification of forest stands to achieve these goals, favouring mixed age structures and polycultures over single-aged monocultures. Evidence is lacking, however, to support this management recommendation for biodiversity gains and related ecosystem service delivery. We used indices of taxonomic diversity and functional structure to compare ground vegetation communities in mixed and pure stands of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and pedunculate oak (Quercus robur) in each of three study regions. We categorised the 91 vascular plant species identified into functional effect and response groups. We tested the hypotheses that ground vegetation communities (i) differ significantly in structure and composition between Scots pine and oak monocultures and (ii) show enhanced levels of taxonomic and functional diversity and functional redundancy in mixed stands of Scots pine and oak compared with monocultures. We explored the implications of any differences in the functional structure of ground vegetation communities in the different stand types on two ecosystem services: nutrient availability and levels of resource provisioning for herbivores. Nine functional response groups (RG) and seven functional effect groups (EG) were identified with considerable overlap in the RG and EG species grouping. Three RGs had traits characteristic of forests (spring flowering herbs, tree saplings and shrubs/climbers), one RG had traits characteristic of open habitats (annual ruderals) and the remaining RGs had more generalist traits (anemochorous perennials, graminoids and short perennials). No significant differences were found among stand types in terms of taxonomic diversity or richness of the different functional trait groups. Ground vegetation communities in the three study regions also had similar levels of functional redundancy across stand types. However, Scots pine and oak monocultures harboured significantly different abundances of species with distinct functional traits. In all three study regions, anemochorous perennials were significantly more abundant in Scots pine monocultures than oak monocultures, while two core forest groups (shrubs/climbers, spring flowering herbs) were significantly more abundant in oak monocultures. Mixed stands had intermediate abundances of these functional groups. These differences have implications for the comparative availability of food resources and shelter for wildlife, but also the mobilisation and temporal availability of nutrients in the two monocultures. Thus, mixtures of Scots pine and pedunculate oak can temper significant tree species identity influences on ground vegetation functional diversity.","[""Diversification"",""Functional redundancy"",""Functional traits"",""Ground vegetation"",""Pinus sylvestris"",""Quercus robur""]","[""Diversification"",""Functional redundancy"",""Functional traits"",""Ground vegetation"",""Pinus sylvestris"",""Quercus robur""]",10.1016/j.foreco.2016.10.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992456268,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/61164/1/Accepted_manuscript.pdf,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. All rights reserved.STUDY QUESTION What is the cost-effectiveness of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) versus double embryo transfer (DET) strategies from a societal perspective, when applying a time horizon of 1, 5 and 18 years? SUMMARY ANSWER From a short-term perspective (1 year) it is cost-effective to replace DET with single embryo transfer; however when intermediate- (5 years) and long-term (18 years) costs and consequences are incorporated, DET becomes the most cost-effective strategy, given a ceiling ratio of €20 000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN According to previous cost-effectiveness research into embryo transfer strategies, DET is considered cost-effective if society is willing to pay around €20 000 for an extra live birth. However, interpretation of those studies is complicated, as those studies fail to incorporate long-term costs and outcomes and used live birth as a measure of effectiveness instead of QALYs. With this outcome, both multiple and singletons were valued as one live birth, whereas costs of all children of a multiple were incorporated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A Markov model (cycle length: 1 year; time horizon: 1, 5 and 18 years) was developed comparing a maximum of: (i) three cycles of eSET in all patients; (ii) four cycles of eSET in all patients; (iii) five cycles of eSET in all patients; (iv) three cycles of standard treatment policy (STP), i.e. eSET in women <38 years with a good quality embryo, and DET in all other women; and (v) three cycles of DET in all patients. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Expected life years (LYs), child QALYs and costs were estimated for all comparators. Input parameters were derived from a retrospective cohort study, in which hospital resource data were collected (n=580) and a parental questionnaire was sent out (431 respondents). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (5000 iterations) was performed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE With a time horizon of 18 years, DETx3 is most effective (0.54 live births, 10.2 LYs and 9.8 QALYs) and expensive (€37 871) per couple starting IVF. Three cycles of eSET are least effective (0.43 live births, 7.1 LYs and 6.8 QALYs) and expensive (€25 563). We assumed that society is willing to pay €20 000 per QALY gained. With a time horizon of 1 year, eSETx3 was the most cost-effective embryo transfer strategy with a probability of being cost-effective of 99.9%. With a time horizon of 5 or 18 years, DETx3 was most cost-effective, with probabilities of being cost-effective of 77.3 and 93.2%, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION This is the first study to use QALYs generated by the children in the economic evaluation of embryo transfer strategies. There remains some disagreement on whether QALYs generated by new life should be used in economic evaluations of fertility treatment. A further limitation is that treatment ends when it results in live birth and that only child QALYs were considered as measure of effectiveness. The results for the time horizon of 18 years might be less solid, as the data beyond the age of 8 years are based on extrapolation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The current Markov model indicates that when child QALYs are used as measure of outcome it is not cost-effective on the long term to replace DET with single embryo transfer strategies. However, for a balanced approach, a family-planning perspective would be preferable, including additional treatment cycles for couples who wish to have another child. Furthermore, the analysis should be extended to include QALYs of family members.

Health-compromising behaviors (smoking, heavy drinking, sugared soft drinks, sweets, fast food, and tanning) declined during the crisis, and all but sweets continued to decline during the recovery. Health-promoting behaviors (consumption of fruit, fish oil, and vitamins/minerals and getting recommended sleep) followed more idiosyncratic paths. Overall, most behaviors reverted back to their pre-crisis levels or trends during the recovery, and these short-term deviations in trajectories were probably too short-lived in this recession to have major impacts on health or mortality. A notable exception is for binge drinking, which declined by 10% during the 2 crisis years, continued to fall (at a slower rate of 8%) during the 3 recovery years, and did not revert back to the upward pre-crisis trend during our observation period. These lingering effects, which directionally run counter to the pre-crisis upward trend in consumption and do not reflect price increases during the recovery period, suggest that alcohol is a potential pathway by which recessions improve health and/or reduce mortality.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Alcohol Drinking"",""Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)"",""Diet"",""Dietary Sucrose"",""Economic Development"",""Economic Recession"",""Fast Foods"",""Female"",""Health Behavior"",""Health Surveys"",""Humans"",""Iceland"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Smoking"",""Sunbathing"",""Young Adult""]","[""Economic crisis"",""Economic recovery"",""Health behaviors"",""Iceland"",""Recessions""]",10.1016/j.ehb.2015.11.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951800127,http://www.canadiancentreforhealtheconomics.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Asgeirsdottir-et-al1.pdf,0

In this article, we test the extent to which established mechanisms behind female politicians' career ambitions-such as differentiated political socialization and family support for men and women-are related to gender inequality among parliamentarians. We also draw attention to other lesser-known aspects, such as political culture and gender policies. To do so, we compare Spain and Sweden, two countries with a relatively high number of female members of parliament (MPs) but different cultures and gender policies. We make use of two representative surveys on Swedish and Spanish MPs. The results show that female MPs in Spain have to sacrifice their family life more than Spanish males and Swedish MPs regardless of sex. In addition, Spanish female MPs' long-term political ambitions are more dependent on family support.

Karger AG, Basel.The World Health Organization AIDS epidemic update estimates that more than 37 million people are living with HIV infection. Despite the unprecedented success of antiretroviral treatments, significant challenges remain in the fight against HIV. In particular, how uninfected cells capture HIV and transmit virions to target cells remains an unanswered question. Tissue mast cells and peripheral blood basophils can be exposed to virions or HIV products during infection. Several HIV proteins (i.e., envelope glycoproteins gp120 and gp41, Tat, and Nef) can interact with distinct surface receptors expressed by human basophils and mast cells and modulate their functional responses at different levels. Additionally, several groups have provided evidence that human mast cells can be infected in vitro, as well as in vivo, by certain strains of HIV. Recently, it has been demonstrated that basophils purified from healthy donors and intestinal mast cells can efficiently capture HIV on their cell surface and, cocultured with CD4+ T cells, they can transfer the virus to the cocultured cells leading to infection. Direct contact between human basophils or intestinal mast cells and CD4+ T cells can mediate viral trans-infection of T cells through the formation of viral synapses. Thus, basophils and mast cells can provide a cellular basis for capturing and then spreading viruses throughout the body. Collectively, these findings suggest that human basophils and mast cells play a complex and possibly distinct role in HIV infection, warranting further investigations.","[""Basophils"",""HIV Infections"",""HIV-1"",""Human Immunodeficiency Virus Proteins"",""Humans"",""Immune System"",""Mast Cells""]","[""Basophils"",""CCR3"",""CCR5"",""CXCR4"",""HIV"",""IL-13"",""IL-4"",""Mast cells"",""Nef"",""TAT""]",10.1159/000452889,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85006309124,https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/452889,0

The oils of seed plants provide the basis for vegetal fat production and the microalgal fats represent an important part of the basal food web of the marine environment. The health-promoting properties of these various sources of fats and in particular the longchain polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine microalgae are widely recognized. The omega-3 fatty acids are known to have benefits on health and disease. Indeed, alpha-linolenic, eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA) are linked to the regulation of mechanisms involved in numerous biological functions associated with cardiovascular disease and cancer prevention. Most EPA and DHA sources for human nutrition are provided by decreasing global stocks of fish.

Despite many available accessibility instruments, they are still not widely used in planning practice. This paper explores the background of this problem by examining the findings of a EU-funded study on the usability and usefulness of existing accessibility instruments. The study applied 16 instruments in local planning contexts according to a standardized process protocol. The outcomes of these so-called experiential workshops were analysed through a standardized measurement protocol, which included participant observation along with pre- and post-workshop practitioner questionnaires. This broad investigation presents a rich analytical tool for understanding how different types of accessibility measures, spatial resolutions of output and levels of comprehensiveness affect usability and usefulness. Based on this we propose 10 technological rules that (a) can be used directly in practice to improve usability of accessibility instruments and (b) can provide hypotheses to be examined in further academic studies. Our results suggest that instead of striving for the ultimate accessibility measure, it would be more effective to identify which measures could successfully serve different user needs in accessibility planning.",,"[""Accessibility instruments"",""experiential case study"",""technological rules"",""urban planning"",""usability"",""usefulness""]",10.1080/09654313.2015.1135231,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961211357,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09654313.2015.1135231?needAccess=true,0

Still, research on effective approaches to reduce consumption is in the early stages. For example, it is not clear whether a widely used approach-descriptive norm demarketing-is effective. Some evidence suggests that this approach actually triggers a boomerang effect, enhancing consumption among some consumer groups. With two experiments (online and lab), the current research contributes to prior work on demarketing and social norms in multiple ways. First, whereas prior work has tested the impact of descriptive norm demarketing on consumer groups classified according to their consumption/usage levels, the current work classifies consumers according to the value system that underlies consumption-that is, materialism. Second, whereas evidence on the boomerang effect has mostly appeared in the energy domain, this research demonstrates the effect across numerous consumption contexts. Third, this research offers a potential remedy to the boomerang effect-namely, carbon labeling that emphasizes the ecological damage of consumption. Finally, the key outcome tested empirically is the actual ecological consequences of consumer behavior in terms of carbon footprint.",,"[""Carbon footprint"",""Carbon labeling"",""Demarketing"",""Descriptive norm"",""Materialism""]",10.1509/jppm.14.064,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978139023,,0

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. All rights reserved.STUDY QUESTION Does a progestin releasing subdermal contraceptive implant affect the efficacy of medical abortion if inserted at the same visit as the progesterone receptor modulator, mifepristone, at medical abortion? SUMMARY ANSWER A etonogestrel releasing subdermal implant inserted on the day of mifepristone did not impair the efficacy of the medical abortion compared with routine insertion at 2-4 weeks after the abortion. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN The etonogestrel releasing subdermal implant is one of the most effective long acting reversible contraceptive methods. The effect of timing of placement on the efficacy of mifepristone and impact on prevention of subsequent unintended pregnancy is not known. STUDY DESIGN SIZE, DURATION This multicentre, randomized controlled, equivalence trial with recruitment between 13 October 2013 and 17 October 2015 included a total of 551 women with pregnancies below 64 days gestation opting for the etonogestrel releasing subdermal implant as postabortion contraception. Women were randomized to either insertion at 1 hour after mifepristone intake (immediate) or at follow-up 2-4 weeks later (delayed insertion). An equivalence design was used due to advantages for women such as fewer visits to the clinic with immediate insertion. The primary outcome was the percentage of women with complete abortion not requiring surgical intervention within 1 month. Secondary outcomes included insertion rates, pregnancy and repeat abortion rates during 6 months follow-up. Analysis was per protocol and by intention to treat. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Women aged 18 years and older who had requested medical termination of a pregnancy up to 63 days of gestation and opted for an etonogestrel releasing contraceptive implant were recruited in outpatient family planning clinics in six hospitals in Sweden and Scotland. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Efficacy of medical abortion was 259/275 (94.2%) in the immediate insertion group and 239/249 (96%) in the routine insertion group with a risk difference of 1.8% (95% CI -0.4 to 4.1%), which was within the ±5% margin of equivalence. The insertion rate was 275/277 (98.9%) in the immediate group compared to 187/261 (71.6%) women in the routine group (P < 0.001). At 6 months of follow-up significantly fewer women in the immediate group had become pregnant again (2/277, 0.8%) compared to the routine group (10/261, 3.8%) P = 0.018. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION For the main outcome loss to follow-up data was minimized through access to patient records. Efforts were made to reduce loss to follow-up also for secondary outcomes. The results of the sensitivity analysis did not differ from the intention to treat or per protocol analysis. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS Guidelines on postabortion contraception should be amended to include insertion of the etonogestrel releasing implant at the time of mifepristone intake for medical abortion up to and including a gestation of 63 days.

Their elucidation is indispensable to gain a comprehensive understanding of the response of ecosystems to global climate change. Here, we investigated soil archaeal, bacterial, and fungal communities at four Alpine forest sites representing a climosequence, over an altitudinal gradient from 545 to 2000 m above sea level (asl), regarding abundance and diversity by using qPCR and Illumina sequencing, respectively. Archaeal community was dominated by Thaumarchaeota, and no significant shifts were detected in abundance or community composition with altitude. The relative bacterial abundance increased at higher altitudes, which was related to increasing levels of soil organic matter and nutrients with altitude. Shifts in bacterial richness and diversity as well as community structure (comprised basically of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes) significantly correlated with several environmental and soil chemical factors, especially soil pH. The site at the lowest altitude harbored the highest bacterial richness and diversity, although richness/diversity community properties did not show a monotonic decrease along the gradient. The relative size of fungal community also increased with altitude and its composition comprised Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Zygomycota. Changes in fungal richness/diversity and community structure were mainly governed by pH and C/N, respectively. The variation of the predominant bacterial and fungal classes over the altitudinal gradient was the result of the environmental and soil chemical factors prevailing at each site.","[""Altitude"",""Archaea"",""Bacteria"",""Biodiversity"",""Chemical Phenomena"",""DNA, Archaeal"",""DNA, Bacterial"",""DNA, Fungal"",""Fungi"",""Italy"",""RNA, Ribosomal, 16S"",""Sequence Analysis, DNA"",""Soil"",""Soil Microbiology"",""Temperature""]","[""Archaea"",""Bacteria"",""Climate change"",""Elevational gradient"",""Fungi"",""Soil metagenomics""]",10.1007/s00248-016-0748-2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960101414,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00248-016-0748-2.pdf,0

Net wealth may correlate with worker’s characteristics that also determine the exit out of a job. It is therefore important to include a rich set of observed characteristics in an empirical model for retirement in order to measure the (marginal) effect of wealth on the job exit rate. But even with a rich set of regressors, the question remains whether there are time-invariant unobservable worker’s characteristics that affect both net wealth and the job exit rate. We specify a simultaneous equations model for job exit transitions with multiple destinations, net wealth, and the initial labour market state. The job exit rates and the net wealth equation contain random effects. We allow for correlation between the random effects of job exit and net wealth, and the initial labour market state. As instruments for wealth, we use survey information that measures ‘shocks’, like shocks to the household’s financial situation during the previous year. Results show an upward bias in the effect of net liquid wealth on retirement, but a small bias and a positive causal effect if net total wealth (including housing equity and mortgage debt) is used. Both measures of wealth show a significant positive effect on retirement. For an average individual with age 58, an increase in net liquid wealth by 64,000 euros, or in net total wealth by 110,000 euros, raises the exit rate into retirement by 1 % point.",,"[""Life-cycle models and saving"",""Models with panel data"",""Retirement""]",10.1007/s00181-015-1016-x,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946949544,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00181-015-1016-x.pdf,0

With the launch of the EU-WFD, the European Union is forcing serious changes in watersheds to reach a “good ecological status”. However, although affirmatively described by experts, not all of these changes are appreciated by local communities. According to Connif (2014), 75 % of river restoration projects did not reach their minimal goals due to the lack of active stakeholder involvement. To prevent this, a comprehensive consideration of social aspects is essential for a sustainable implementation success of river restoration projects in the German water management sector. In this paper, local stakeholders’ individual acceptance and the overall public acceptance of the project to ecologically improve the Emscher River’s mouth in the context of the Emscher Conversion (“Emscherumbau”) and its relation to certain steps of action in the project (including public participation measures) will be discussed as a case study. To our knowledge, no other research has been conducted so far combining the advantages of qualitative stakeholder interviews and a comprehensive media analysis to get an individual insight into the attitude of different stakeholder groups and to consistently identify snapshots of the public attitude during the course of the project. At first sight the project has high potential for conflicts because of drastic alterations of the current environment, intense construction works and soil transport activities, a relatively dense settlement in close proximity as well as a community that is experienced in asserting their rights. But although public participation was basically limited to information and formal consultation, the local attitude towards the ecological improvement of the Emscher River’s mouth is overall positive.","[""Acceptance"",""Public participation"",""River basin management"",""River restoration"",""Water infrastructure""]","[""Acceptance"",""Emscher Conversion"",""EU-WFD"",""Public participation"",""River basin management"",""River restoration"",""Water infrastructure""]",10.1007/s12665-016-5787-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977126000,,0

Methods Rats were implanted with VBLOC, an intra-abdominal electrical device with leads placed around gastric vagal trunks through an abdominal incision and controlled by wireless device. Body weight, food intake, hunger/satiety, and metabolic parameters were monitored by a comprehensive laboratory animal monitoring system. Brain-gut responses were analyzed physiologically. Results VBLOC reduced body weight and food intake, which was associated with increased satiety but not with decreased hunger. Brain activities in response to VBLOC included increased gene expression of leptin and CCKb receptors, interleukin-1β, tumor necrosis factor, and transforming growth factor β1 in the brainstem; increased CCK, somatostatin, and tyrosine hydroxy-lase in the hippocampus; increased NPY, AgRP, and Foxa2 in the hypothalamus; and reduced CCKb receptor, melanocortin 4 receptor, and insulin receptor in the hypothalamus.

It appears to result from an irritation caused by the beaks of the cephalopods on which they feed. The link between ambergris and whales, if not the mechanism by which ambergris is produced, has been addressed throughout history but, due to contradictory reports and fanciful explanations regarding its origin, only recently has it been widely accepted. Since ancient times ambergris has been used for medicinal purposes and in perfumes, but its supposed exotic properties are an important reason for the European demand for this substance. Accounts about ambergris from places where Europeans sailed since the 15th century are numerous. In the 16th and 17th centuries there were no laws dictating who owned the ambergris found on beaches and many pieces were sold or traded, legally or illegally, from overseas to Europe. However, this product was always obtained in relatively small quantities. More recently, with the advent of industrial whaling dedicated to sperm whaling conducted by several nations in various parts of the world during the 19th and 20th centuries, ambergris acquired an importance of its own and was sold at very high prices. In the Azores, ambergris from hunted sperm whales was documented; the same applies for Madeira and the Portuguese mainland.

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology. All rights reserved.STUDY QUESTION What is the cost-effectiveness of elective single embryo transfer (eSET) versus double embryo transfer (DET) strategies from a societal perspective, when applying a time horizon of 1, 5 and 18 years? SUMMARY ANSWER From a short-term perspective (1 year) it is cost-effective to replace DET with single embryo transfer; however when intermediate- (5 years) and long-term (18 years) costs and consequences are incorporated, DET becomes the most cost-effective strategy, given a ceiling ratio of €20 000 per quality-adjusted life years (QALY) gained. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN According to previous cost-effectiveness research into embryo transfer strategies, DET is considered cost-effective if society is willing to pay around €20 000 for an extra live birth. However, interpretation of those studies is complicated, as those studies fail to incorporate long-term costs and outcomes and used live birth as a measure of effectiveness instead of QALYs. With this outcome, both multiple and singletons were valued as one live birth, whereas costs of all children of a multiple were incorporated. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A Markov model (cycle length: 1 year; time horizon: 1, 5 and 18 years) was developed comparing a maximum of: (i) three cycles of eSET in all patients; (ii) four cycles of eSET in all patients; (iii) five cycles of eSET in all patients; (iv) three cycles of standard treatment policy (STP), i.e. eSET in women <38 years with a good quality embryo, and DET in all other women; and (v) three cycles of DET in all patients. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Expected life years (LYs), child QALYs and costs were estimated for all comparators. Input parameters were derived from a retrospective cohort study, in which hospital resource data were collected (n=580) and a parental questionnaire was sent out (431 respondents). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (5000 iterations) was performed. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE With a time horizon of 18 years, DETx3 is most effective (0.54 live births, 10.2 LYs and 9.8 QALYs) and expensive (€37 871) per couple starting IVF. Three cycles of eSET are least effective (0.43 live births, 7.1 LYs and 6.8 QALYs) and expensive (€25 563). We assumed that society is willing to pay €20 000 per QALY gained. With a time horizon of 1 year, eSETx3 was the most cost-effective embryo transfer strategy with a probability of being cost-effective of 99.9%. With a time horizon of 5 or 18 years, DETx3 was most cost-effective, with probabilities of being cost-effective of 77.3 and 93.2%, respectively. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION This is the first study to use QALYs generated by the children in the economic evaluation of embryo transfer strategies. There remains some disagreement on whether QALYs generated by new life should be used in economic evaluations of fertility treatment. A further limitation is that treatment ends when it results in live birth and that only child QALYs were considered as measure of effectiveness. The results for the time horizon of 18 years might be less solid, as the data beyond the age of 8 years are based on extrapolation. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The current Markov model indicates that when child QALYs are used as measure of outcome it is not cost-effective on the long term to replace DET with single embryo transfer strategies. However, for a balanced approach, a family-planning perspective would be preferable, including additional treatment cycles for couples who wish to have another child. Furthermore, the analysis should be extended to include QALYs of family members.

This study aimed to study the incidence of MNM and quality of care at a district hospital in rural Rwanda by applying this approach. Methods: A facility based, prospective cohort study conducted at a district hospital in rural Rwanda between June 2013 and December 2014. Subjects were followed from time of admission to discharge or death. Results: In 3979 deliveries, 3827 singletons and 152 twins pairs were born. Among the 4131 neonates, there were 3994 live births and 137 stillbirths. Ninety-nine women suffered severe maternal outcome (SMO): 86 maternal near misses and 13 deaths. This adds up to a maternal near miss ratio of 21.5 per 1000 live births (95 % CI 17.3-26.5), a maternal mortality ratio of 325 per 100 000 live births (95 % CI 181-543) and a mortality index of 13.1 % (95 % CI 7.3-21.9). Hemorrhage (n = 49, 57 %) and hypertensive disorders (n = 27, 31.4 %) were the commonest MNM conditions. Eclampsia (n = 4/13; 30.7 %) was the leading cause of maternal mortality, while sepsis/peritonitis following cesarean section (n = 2/6; 33.3 %) had the highest mortality index. Seventy-seven out of 99 SMO cases (77.9 %) were referred from other facilities with critical conditions and 28 out of 99 SMO cases (28.3 %) were admitted into the Intensive Care Unit. Several indicators such as administration of oxytocin, magnesium sulfate and antibiotics were found to be suboptimal. Conclusions: MNM is common at district level in Rwanda.

Conclusions: Data of the present study suggest that, in the setting of neuroprotected CAS performed in high-volume centres by properly trained operators, the use of an open-cell design stent with a free cell area >7.5 mm2 may be associated with an increased 30-day stroke risk.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Angioplasty"",""Carotid Artery Diseases"",""Carotid Stenosis"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Prosthesis Design"",""Registries"",""Risk Assessment"",""Risk Factors"",""Stents"",""Time Factors"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""Carotid arteries"",""Stents"",""Stroke""]",10.4244/EIJV12I2A41,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975859176,,0

So far the complex has been classified into three species, C. atrolabiata from the north-western Caucasus, C. calligera from Transcaucasia and C. intercedens from the eastern Pontus Mountains. Phylogenetic (neighbor-net and neighbor-joining tree) as well as admixture analyses based on AFLP data showed that the complex consists of two population clusters corresponding to C. atrolabiata and C. calligera. The populations assigned to C. intercedens in fact represent hybrids consisting of different proportions of the genomes of C. atrolabiata and C. calligera. There is a broad transition zone between C. atrolabiata and C. calligera in the Pontic Mountains and a second transition zone in Abkhazia. Because of evidence for gene flow, it is suggested to classify the two aforementioned taxa as subspecies, namely C. a. atrolabiata and C. a. calligera. The presence of mitochondrial C. a. atrolabiata haplotypes in Turkey can only be explained by passive dispersal across the Black Sea. The distribution of C. a. atrolabiata and additional cases of land snails with disjunct Transpontic distribution patterns cannot be ascribed to a common cause but are results of long distance dispersal events at different times.","[""Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis"",""Animals"",""Cluster Analysis"",""Cytochromes c"",""DNA, Mitochondrial"",""Genetic Variation"",""Haplotypes"",""Phylogeny"",""Phylogeography"",""Russia"",""Snails"",""Turkey""]","[""Biogeography"",""Caucasus"",""Helicoidea"",""Hybridization"",""Refugia""]",10.1016/j.ympev.2016.07.017,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979792036,,0

We found that participants' gender and their identification with the violent male video game character moderated the effects of the exposure to sexist-violent video games on masculine beliefs. Our results supported the prediction that playing violent- sexist video games increases masculine beliefs, which occurred for male (but not female) participants who were highly identified with the game character.

People who settled in the area received a name Pomory, from Russian po moriu, meaning by sea, because their subsistence activities became marine fishing and hunting and seafaring. Local fisheries have undergone significant changes as post-Soviet Russia embraced the market economy and the state introduced fishing concessions. The current Russian law only allows fishing for salmon through officially registered recreational or commercial fisheries. Both these options are often either unavailable or unaffordable to rural dwellers, which leaves them with limited or no legal access to their traditional salmon fisheries. There has been a growing concern for protecting communities’ fishing rights among wider society in Arkhangelsk oblast. City activists promoted Pomory identity and appealed to the Russian government to grant Pomory an indigenous status to secure their access to fisheries. Although Pomor activism did not reach most of its proclaimed goals, it has contributed to promoting the image of Arkhangelsk oblast as a homeland to Pomor fishing. This image has played an important part in what Arkhangelsk authorities have called socially-oriented fisheries management. Officials have made good attempts to better accommodate rural communities’ access to fishing resources. Yet, these attempts have failed to include fishermen as active participants in the process. This paper looks at constraints on community participation in fisheries management in Russia.

Short-term consequences are mostly represented by psychological effects; in fact obese children have more chances to develop psychological or psychiatric problems than non-obese children. The main long-term effect is represented by the fact that childhood obesity continues into adulthood obesity and this results in negative effects in young adult life, since obesity increases the risk to develop morbidity and premature mortality. The obesity-related diseases are mostly represented by hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular diseases. Medical treatment should be discouraged in childhood because of the side effects and it should be only reserved for obese children with related medical complications.

Journal of Applied Ecology © 2016 British Ecological SocietyPlant communities of coastal dunes are highly biodiverse and greatly valued for the services they provide, yet they are also threatened by global change and are often neglected in conservation planning. To determine the long-term effectiveness of conservation actions on Mediterranean coastal dunes, here we focus on Italy's coastline and (i) assess how the vegetation cover of the major psammophilous habitats and species has changed since the 1960s, (ii) identify which ecological strategies have been most successful in the face of global change and (iii) evaluate the efficacy of the protected areas network for safeguarding plant communities of coastal dunes. We compiled 2583 geo-located vegetation relevés spanning over half a century and covering the entire length of Italy's sandy coastline. Using this data base, we developed statistical models to test whether the vegetation cover of both individual species and habitats has changed over time. We then tested whether species-level changes in vegetation cover through time could be explained by species’ functional traits and ecological strategy. Finally, we assessed the efficacy of current conservation measures by exploring how vegetation cover responded following the expansion of the protected areas network. Our results indicate that, where protected, plant communities have generally increased in vegetation cover in recent years. The strongest increase in cover occurred in the wooded dune habitats, where late-successional, tall-growing and large-seeded species show the clearest signs of recovery. However, this has come in part at the expense of dune grasslands, which thrive under natural disturbance and have declined since the 1960s. The Natura 2000 network seems to have played a central role in this recovery process, as the cumulative coastal land area under protection has tripled since the network was first established. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that protected areas can play an important role in safeguarding coastal dune plant communities against land-use transformations. In this context, functional traits can be a powerful tool in guiding conservation planning, helping to identify groups of species most at risk of population declines. Nonetheless, future conservation interventions need to be mindful to ensure that the natural disturbance regime of dune ecosystems is not disrupted.",,"[""coastal habitats conservation"",""dunes"",""ecological indicators"",""functional traits"",""land-use change"",""Natura 2000 network"",""protected areas"",""psammophilous habitats"",""temporal trends"",""vegetation data base""]",10.1111/1365-2664.12684,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971450263,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1365-2664.12684,0

We applied 2D-gel proteomics analysis on A549 epithelial alveolar cells chronically exposed for 2 months to 2.5 or 50 μg/mL of deeply characterized TiO2-NPs, in order to obtain comprehensive molecular responses that may reflect functional outcomes. We show that exposure to TiO2-NPs impacts the abundance of 30 protein species, corresponding to 22 gene products. These proteins are involved in glucose metabolism, trafficking, gene expression, mitochondrial function, proteasome activity and DNA damage response. Besides, our results suggest that p53 pathway is activated, slowing down cell cycle progression and reducing cell proliferation rate. Moreover, we report increased content of chaperones-related proteins, which suggests homeostasis re-establishment. Finally, our results highlight that chronic exposure to TiO2-NPs affects the same cellular functions as acute exposure to TiO2-NPs, although lower exposure concentrations and longer exposure times induce more intense cellular response. Biological significance: Our results make possible the identification of new mechanisms that explain TiO2-NP toxicity upon long-term, in vitro exposure of A549 cells. It is the first article describing -omics results obtained with this experimental strategy. We show that this long-term exposure modifies the cellular content of proteins involved in functions including mitochondrial activity, intra- and extracellular trafficking, proteasome activity, glucose metabolism, and gene expression. Moreover we observe modification of content of proteins that activate the p53 pathway, which suggest the induction of a DNA damage response. Technically, our results show that exposure of A549 cells to a high concentration of TiO2-NPs leads to the identification of modulations of the same functional categories than exposure to low, more realistic concentrations. Still the intensity differs between these two exposure scenarios. We also show that chronic exposure to TiO2-NPs induces the modulation of cellular functions that have already been reported in the literature as being impacted in acute exposure scenarios. This proves that the exposure protocol in in vitro experiments related to nanoparticle toxicology might be cautiously chosen since inappropriate scenario may lead to inappropriate and/or incomplete conclusions.","[""Cell Line, Tumor"",""Epithelial Cells"",""Humans"",""Nanoparticles"",""Proteome"",""Proteomics"",""Pulmonary Alveoli"",""Respiratory Mucosa"",""Titanium""]","[""A549"",""Chronic exposure"",""Long-term exposure"",""Nanoparticle"",""Toxicity"",""Whole-proteome expression""]",10.1016/j.jprot.2015.08.006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958164156,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01291979/file/A549%20TiO2complFinal.pdf,0

Older Care-Home residents are often not involved in research processes even when studies are Care-Home focused. Objective: to conduct a systematic review to find out to what extent and how older Care-Home residents have been involved in research as collaborators or advisors. Methods: a systematic literature search of 12 databases, covering the period from 1990 to September 2014 was conducted. A lateral search was also carried out. Standardised inclusion criteria were used and checked independently by two researchers. Results: nineteen reports and papers were identified relating to 11 different studies. Care-Home residents had been involved in the research process in multiple ways. Two key themes were identified: (i) the differences in residents' involvement in smallscale and Large-Scale studies and (ii) the barriers to and facilitators of involvement. Conclusions: Small-Scale studies involved residents as collaborators in participatory action research, whereas larger studies involved residents as consultants in advisory roles. There are multiple facilitators of and barriers to involving residents as PPI members. The reporting of PPI varies.

CC Attribution 3.0 License.Traditionally, long-term predictions of river discharges and their extremes include constant relationships between landscape properties and model parameters. However, due to the co-evolution of many landscape properties more sophisticated methods are necessary to quantify future landscape-hydrological model relationships. As a first step towards such an approach we use the Brutsaert and Nieber (1977) analysis method to characterize streamflow recession behaviour of 200 Swedish catchments within the context of global change and landscape co-evolution. Results suggest that the Brutsaert-Nieber parameters are strongly linked to the climate, soil, land use, and their interdependencies. Many catchments show a trend towards more non-linear behaviour, meaning not only faster initial recession but also slower recession towards base flow. This trend has been found to be independent from climate change. Instead, we suggest that land cover change, both natural (restoration of natural soil profiles in forested areas) and anthropogenic (reforestation and optimized water management), is probably responsible. Both change types are characterised by system adaptation and change, towards more optimal ecohydrological conditions, suggesting landscape co-evolution is at play. Given the observed magnitudes of recession changes during the past 50 years, predictions of future river discharge critically need to include the effects of landscape co-evolution. The interconnections between the controls of land cover and climate on river recession behaviour, as we have quantified in this paper, provide first-order handles to do so.","[""Hydrological modeling"",""Land-cover change"",""Landscape properties"",""Long-term prediction"",""Model parameters"",""Nonlinear behaviours"",""River discharge"",""System adaptation""]",,10.5194/hess-20-1413-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969261465,https://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci.net/20/1413/2016/hess-20-1413-2016.pdf,0

The research was carried out within the European/African FP7 project CLimate change and Urban Vulnerability in Africa, which investigated climate change-induced risks, assessed vulnerability and proposed policy initiatives in five African cities. Dar es Salaam (Tanzania) was used as a main case with a particular focus on urban flooding. The multi-dimensional assessment covered the physical, institutional, attitudinal and asset factors influencing urban vulnerability. Multiple methods were applied to cover the full range of vulnerabilities and to identify potential response strategies, including: model-based forecasts, spatial analyses, document studies, interviews and stakeholder workshops. We demonstrate the potential of the approach to assessing several dimensions of vulnerability and illustrate the complexity of urban vulnerability at different scales: households (e.g., lacking assets); communities (e.g., situated in low-lying areas, lacking urban services and green areas); and entire cities (e.g., facing encroachment on green and flood-prone land). Scenario modeling suggests that vulnerability will continue to increase strongly due to the expected loss of agricultural land at the urban fringes and loss of green space within the city. However, weak institutional commitment and capacity limit the potential for strategic coordination and action. To better adapt to urban flooding and thereby reduce vulnerability and build resilience, we suggest working across dimensions and scales, integrating climate change issues in city-level plans and strategies and enabling local actions to initiate a ‘learning-by-doing’ process of adaptation.",,"[""Africa"",""Climate change"",""Dar es Salaam"",""Urban"",""Vulnerability assessment""]",10.1007/s11069-015-1856-x,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84930912389,https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-multidimensional-assessment-of-urban-vulnerability-to-climate-change-in-subsaharan-africa(208da753-17ce-4071-acb6-384344a2ef52).html,0

A harmonised meta-analysis of data from more than 1 million men and women","© 2016 Elsevier LtdBackground High amounts of sedentary behaviour have been associated with increased risks of several chronic conditions and mortality. However, it is unclear whether physical activity attenuates or even eliminates the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting. We examined the associations of sedentary behaviour and physical activity with all-cause mortality. Methods We did a systematic review, searching six databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, Sport Discus, and Scopus) from database inception until October, 2015, for prospective cohort studies that had individual level exposure and outcome data, provided data on both daily sitting or TV-viewing time and physical activity, and reported effect estimates for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality, or breast, colon, and colorectal cancer mortality. We included data from 16 studies, of which 14 were identified through a systematic review and two were additional unpublished studies where pertinent data were available. All study data were analysed according to a harmonised protocol, which categorised reported daily sitting time and TV-viewing time into four standardised groups each, and physical activity into quartiles (in metabolic equivalent of task [MET]-hours per week). We then combined data across all studies to analyse the association of daily sitting time and physical activity with all-cause mortality, and estimated summary hazard ratios using Cox regression. We repeated these analyses using TV-viewing time instead of daily sitting time. Findings Of the 16 studies included in the meta-analysis, 13 studies provided data on sitting time and all-cause mortality. These studies included 1 005 791 individuals who were followed up for 2–18·1 years, during which 84 609 (8·4%) died. Compared with the referent group (ie, those sitting <4 h/day and in the most active quartile [>35·5 MET-h per week]), mortality rates during follow-up were 12–59% higher in the two lowest quartiles of physical activity (from HR=1·12, 95% CI 1·08–1·16, for the second lowest quartile of physical activity [<16 MET-h per week] and sitting <4 h/day; to HR=1·59, 1·52–1·66, for the lowest quartile of physical activity [<2·5 MET-h per week] and sitting >8 h/day). Daily sitting time was not associated with increased all-cause mortality in those in the most active quartile of physical activity. Compared with the referent (<4 h of sitting per day and highest quartile of physical activity [>35·5 MET-h per week]), there was no increased risk of mortality during follow-up in those who sat for more than 8 h/day but who also reported >35·5 MET-h per week of activity (HR=1·04; 95% CI 0·99–1·10). By contrast, those who sat the least (<4 h/day) and were in the lowest activity quartile (<2·5 MET-h per week) had a significantly increased risk of dying during follow-up (HR=1·27, 95% CI 1·22–1·31). Six studies had data on TV-viewing time (N=465 450; 43 740 deaths). Watching TV for 3 h or more per day was associated with increased mortality regardless of physical activity, except in the most active quartile, where mortality was significantly increased only in people who watched TV for 5 h/day or more (HR=1·16, 1·05–1·28). Interpretation High levels of moderate intensity physical activity (ie, about 60–75 min per day) seem to eliminate the increased risk of death associated with high sitting time. However, this high activity level attenuates, but does not eliminate the increased risk associated with high TV-viewing time.

Although it is the optimal mode of feeding for infants younger than 6 months, its prevalence is low in HIV-endemic regions. Extensive promotion of EBF for 6 months in prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programs could inadvertently result in stigma due to women's perceived association of EBF with HIV infection. In this qualitative study, we describe how stigma impacts the uptake of EBF among HIV-positive and -negative women. Methods: Pregnant and postpartum women and their male partners were recruited to participate in a total of 22 focus group discussions (FGDs). Transcripts were analyzed using ATLAS.ti. Codes were identified both a priori and inductively using the open coding approach. Major themes and subthemes were identified. Results: There was a broad and strong consensus among some FGD participants that HIV-related stigma was a barrier to EBF. EBF was perceived as a practice for HIV-positive women. Thus, fear of discrimination deterred both HIV-positive and -negative women from EBF. However, with health education, peer counselor, and male partner support, some women were able to breastfeed exclusively regardless of opposing social norms. Conclusion: Stigma related to HIV poses a formidable barrier to EBF in HIV-endemic regions. There is an urgent need to widely target all women with EBF information and support EBF practices regardless of maternal HIV infection status. The lessons learned from this study indicate that vertical programs can hinder promotion of infant health interventions and therefore negatively affect child survival.","[""Adult"",""Breast Feeding"",""Female"",""Focus Groups"",""Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"",""HIV Seronegativity"",""HIV Seropositivity"",""Humans"",""Infant"",""Infant, Newborn"",""Infectious Disease Transmission, Vertical"",""Kenya"",""Male"",""Maternal-Child Health Services"",""Mothers"",""Nurse Midwives"",""Qualitative Research"",""Social Stigma""]",,10.1089/bfm.2016.0014,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975321435,http://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4921896?pdf=render,0

We aimed to investigate the relationship between OA and mortality from any cause and from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods Electronic literature databases searches were conducted to identify prospective studies comparing mortality in a sample of people with and without OA. Risk of all-cause and CVD mortality were summarized using adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for joint specific (hand, hip, and knee) and joint non-specific OA. New data from the Progetto Veneto Anziani (PRO.V.A.) study were also included. Results From the PRO.V.A. study (N = 2927), there was no significant increase in mortality risk for participants with any joint OA (N = 1858) compared to non-OA (all-cause, HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.77–1.15 and CVD, HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.82–1.54). On meta-analysis, seven studies (OA = 10,018/non-OA = 18,541), with a median 12-year follow-up, reported no increased risk of any-cause mortality in those with OA (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.97–1.25). After removing data on hand OA, a significant association between OA and mortality was observed (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08–1.28). There was a significant higher risk of overall mortality for (1) studies conducted in Europe, (2) patients with multi-joint OA; and (3) a radiological diagnosis of OA. OA was associated with significantly higher CVD mortality (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.10–1.34). Conclusions People with OA are at increased risk of death due to CVD. The relationship with overall mortality is less clear and may be moderated by the presence of hand OA.","[""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Comorbidity"",""Humans"",""Osteoarthritis"",""Prospective Studies"",""Risk Factors""]","[""Cardiovascular disease"",""Mortality"",""Osteoarthritis""]",10.1016/j.semarthrit.2016.04.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84970021650,http://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/15834/1/15834_Thompson_Osteoarthritis%20and%20mortality%20%28AAM%29%202016.pdf,0

Methods: The study included 411 patients treated with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer with lymph node metastases at 10 tertiary care centers between 1995 and 2014. Kaplan–Meier analyses were used to assess cancer-specific mortality-free survival rates at 8 years' follow up in the overall population, and after stratifying patients according to clinical and pathological parameters. Uni- and multivariable competing risk Cox regression analyses were used to assess cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality. Finally, cumulative-incidence plots were generated for cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality after stratifying patients according to the number of positive lymph nodes and the median age at surgery, according to the competing risks method. Results: Men with prostate-specific antigen ≤40 ng/mL and those with one to three positive lymph nodes showed higher cancer-specific mortality-free survival estimates as compared with their counterparts with prostate-specific antigen >40 ng/mL and >3 metastatic lymph nodes, respectively (all P < 0.001). At multivariable Cox regression analyses, preoperative prostate-specific antigen >40 ng/mL, >3 lymph node metastases and pathological Gleason score 8–10 were all independent predictors of cancer-specific mortality (all P-values ≤0.001). On competing risk analysis, when patients were stratified according to the number of positive lymph nodes (namely, ≤3 vs >3), the 8-year cancer-specific mortality rates were 27.4% versus 44.8% for patients aged <65 years, and 15.2% versus 52.6% for patients aged ≥65 years, respectively. Conclusions: Three positive lymph nodes represent the best prognostic cut-off in node-positive prostate cancer patients. In those individuals with >3 positive lymph nodes, the overall mortality rate is completely related to prostate cancer in young patients.","[""Humans"",""Laparoscopy"",""Lymph Node Excision"",""Lymph Nodes"",""Lymphatic Metastasis"",""Male"",""Prognosis"",""Prostate-Specific Antigen"",""Prostatectomy"",""Prostatic Neoplasms"",""Risk"",""Robotic Surgical Procedures"",""Survival Analysis""]","[""cancer-specific mortality"",""competing risk analysis"",""lymph node metastases"",""other-cause mortality"",""radical prostatectomy""]",10.1111/iju.13203,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84999751850,https://iris.unipa.it/retrieve/handle/10447/352448/694622/Schiavina_et_al-2016-International_Journal_of_Urology.pdf,0

Background Despite an increase number of women who graduate from medical school in France during the last generation today, women represent only 24% of all cardiologists and 3% are interventional cardiologists. To face this international gender-based issue of interventional cardiology, committees were established in US (WIN) and recently within the EAPCI: the Women EAPCI chaired by Drs Mehilli and Mauri. In France, the Intervention'Elles committee emerged in order to participate in this concern. Methods As a first initiative, the Intervention'Elles group launched an e-survey to obtain information on the population of French female interventional cardiologists, focused on demography, work patterns, maternity and radiation exposure. Results Mean age is 40 years old (±7,4), 68% are working in large volume center, 28% have also structural interventional activity. Only 40% have left arm coverage. Despite 80% of French female interventional cardiologists wear personal dosimeters only 45% of them have a dosimetry feedback. Interestingly, even if 54% of women have children (mean: 1.9 ± 1) 28% of them report that childbearing had interfered with their career plan. Conclusion This questionnaire identifies for the first time the women population in interventional cardiology in France and highlights some of the issues encountered in more detail.

However, although the body of evidence on the ecotoxicology of pharmaceutical mixtures is quite consistent, the current guidelines for the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals often do not explicitly address mixture effects. Data availability and acceptable methods often limit such assessments. A tiered approach that begins with summing up individual risk quotients, i.e., the ratio between the predicted or measured environmental concentration and the predicted no effect concentration (PNEC) is therefore suggested in this paper, in order to improve the realism of the environmental risk assessment of pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the use of a mixture-specific assessment factor, as well as the classical mixture toxicity concepts of concentration addition and independent action is explored. Finally, specific attention is given to the exposure-based waiving of environmental risk assessments, as currently implemented in screening or pre-screening phases (tier 0 in Europe, categorical exclusion in the USA), since even low, individually non-toxic concentrations might combine to produce substantial mixture effects.","[""Ecotoxicology"",""Environment"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Europe"",""Risk Assessment"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""concentration addition"",""environmental risk assessment"",""independent action"",""mixture assessment factor"",""mixture risk assessment""]",10.1208/s12248-016-9907-0,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962146841,,0

Preliminary lab scale experiments were performed by using a solar simulator in order to evaluate the proper initial dose of H2O2 and PAA, respectively. According to the results achieved, 50 and 100 mg L−1 of H2O2 and 4 and 8 mg L−1 of PAA were chosen for the subsequent pilot scale experiments in a Compound Parabolic Collector (CPC) based reactor. The sunlight/PAA process resulted in a higher inactivation rate (3.52 log units of E. coli and 4.50 log units of Enterococci with an initial dose of 8 mg PAA L−1) compared to sunlight/H2O2 process (3.13 log units of E. coli and 2.45 log units of Enterococci with an initial dose of 100 mg H2O2 L−1) after 120 min of solar irradiation (7.42 kJ L−1 cumulative energy per unit of volume).

We develop cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses as well as analyses of correlation that underline the main differences between the way farms adapt their structure and management towards risk. The expected output is an analysis of farms’ approach to risk management in relation to the risk exposure. The present study is the result of research conducted by INEA “Research and technical support on natural disasters, climatic and phytosanitary risks in agriculture and related policies”, funded by the Italian Ministry of Agricultural Food and Forestry Policies. The main aim of this analysis is to explore the potential and the limitations of economic tools for climatic risk management in agriculture of new CAP 2013-2020 in relation to farms’ needs, possible or necessary policies and future directions in the context of the Italian experience (National Solidarity Fund for natural disasters in agriculture, legislative decree n. 102/2004). The chosen approach for the analysis of demand considers the climatic risk at the level of farms’ approach to hedging risks in terms of the use of technical tools (agricultural practices, pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation) and economic/financial instruments (insurances, etc.). The results show a preference of technical tools and a strong need of a more integrated policy scheme, arising also from a new system and the potential synergies between risk management tools and other rural development measures of a more structural and management nature. The latter can contribute to a reduction of risk exposure and of the farms’ vulnerability, first and foremost through agro-climatic-environmental measures, production diversification, irrigation infrastructures, technological and management innovations and formation-information-consultancy.",,"[""Agriculture and Climate Change"",""CAP Sustainability"",""Climatic Risk Management"",""Insurance Schemes"",""Policy Assessment""]",10.3844/ajassp.2016.408.419,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84965071568,http://thescipub.com/pdf/10.3844/ajassp.2016.408.419,0

We illustrate the analytical results by calibrating the model to the German electricity market. The first-best market equilibrium of the model implies an increase of reserve provision with a growing share of renewable generation. Furthermore, a growing share of renewable generation decreases the level of reliability as measured in energy not served (ENS). Additionally, required reserves to balance higher expected deviations will be more expensive, resulting in a trade-off between higher reserve costs and costs of ENS.","[""Analytical results"",""Market equilibria"",""Optimal reliability"",""Renewable electricity"",""Renewable energy source"",""Renewable generation"",""reserves"",""Stochastic demand""]","[""electricity market"",""outages"",""reliability"",""reserves"",""TSO""]",10.1109/ENERGYCON.2016.7513909,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982812098,,0

Contrary to the West, the women’s participation rate in business has been traditionally high in China. The purpose of this paper is to find out whether gender-diverse corporate boards of Chinese automotive firms perform better financially than gender-homogeneous boards. Design/methodology/approach: By drawing on data from the Chinese Government and Bloomberg, the authors compare and analyze the differences in financial performance (return on equity, asset growth, sales growth) and risk behavior (debt risk, R&D expenditure) of Chinese automotive firms with and without women on their corporate board. Findings: There is significant evidence that firms with women on the board perform better across all three categories, with the exception of return on equity, for which they found no significant differences among the analyzed firms. Practical implications: While women’s participation in corporate boards in China is low, the results of this study suggest to policy makers and firms alike to implement measures that support gender-diversified boards in order to take advantage of their potential to increase corporate performance. Originality/value: So far, the performance of corporate boards of countries with a traditionally high share of female participation in the workforce has rarely been analyzed. Research focusing on the Chinese automotive industry is new and underrepresented, although China is the largest automotive market worldwide and a key industry of the domestic economy. This investigation contributes to the literature stream on board diversity in as well as to industry-related studies.

How has the ecosystem-services perspective been integrated into strategies for aquatic habitat conservation? Literature on conservation of diverse freshwater and marine habitats was reviewed to assess the extent to which past and current strategies specifically targeted ecosystem services, and considered ecosystem functions, potential trade-offs and social issues when formulating protection measures for conserving aquatic habitats. Surprisingly few published examples exist where comprehensive assessment of ecosystem services supported development of conservation plans. Seldom were aquatic habitat conservation objectives framed in terms of balancing trade-offs, assessing social values and evaluating suites of ecosystem services under different strategies. Time frames for achieving these objectives were also rarely specified. There was no evidence for fundamental differences between marine and freshwater habitats with respect to their ecosystem services that should be considered when setting targets for their conservation. When an ecosystem-service perspective is used for setting objectives in aquatic habitat conservation, the following actions are recommended: (1) explicitly listing and evaluating full suites of ecosystem services to be conserved; (2) identifying current and future potential trade-offs arising from conservation; (3) specifying time frames within which particular strategies might protect or enhance desired services; and (4) predicting how different proposed strategies might affect each ecosystem function, service flow and public benefit. This approach will help ensure that less-apparent ecosystem services (e.g. regulating, supporting) and their associated ecosystem functions receive adequate recognition and protection in aquatic conservation of freshwater and marine habitats. However, conservation objectives should not focus solely on protecting or enhancing ecosystem services but complement current strategies targeting biodiversity and other conservation goals.

The population at South Georgia is currently exploited by pelagic trawlers fishing close to the seabed. Annual catches peaked at 150,000 t in 1983 and have declined since the mid-to-late 1980s. Bottom-trawl surveys have been conducted since 1987, providing a time series of abundance and size distribution for use in assessing the status of the stock and setting quotas. Food web models suggest that estimates of the biomass from survey data are substantially lower than the amount of icefish required by the local ecosystem. The aim of this study was to assess the uncertainty around current estimates of density and variance, using alternative nonparametric stratified bootstrapping methods. The stratified rescaling bootstrap estimator was identified as the most appropriate method of those tested: in comparison with the existing method, confidence intervals and the inter-annual variability of the estimates were reduced. Numbers-at-age were estimated from mixture distribution models fitted to length-disaggregated density data in order to determine whether individual cohorts were consistently detected by the surveys. Estimates of numbers-at-age could not consistently delineate cohorts in successive years indicating that survey-based estimates of density were biased. These biases may have arisen because the trawl gear did not select individuals of all sizes equally, or because sampling was restricted to the demersal component of the stock. Estimates of abundance of the pelagic component of the stock should be derived from acoustic data to improve the assessment.",,"[""Mackerel icefish"",""Stratified bootstrap"",""Trawl survey""]",10.1007/s00300-015-1810-0,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84944937974,https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/8428/1/Fallon_etal_2015_icefish_trawl_surveys_REF.pdf,0

Gibson, R. J. A. Atkinson, and J. D. M. Gordon.Cephalopods play a significant role in coastal and oceanic ecosystems, both as consumers of invertebrates and small fish and as the prey of some fish, seabirds and marine mammals and other large predators. Approximately 30 species of cephalopod have been recorded in the north-eastern Atlantic and adjacent waters, including 18 teuthid (squid), seven sepiolid (bobtail), three sepiid (cuttlefish) and 10 octopod (octopus) species. A number of these are exploited commercially and support important target and by-catch fisheries in Western Europe. During the past decade, annual landings of cephalopods from the north-eastern Atlantic (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea [ICES] area) have ranged from 40,000 to 55,000 t, including substantial catches of long-fin (loliginid) squid (7000-11,000 t per annum), short-fin (ommastrephid) squid (3000-10,000 t), cuttlefish (including sepiolids; 16,000-24,000 t) and octopods (12,000-18,000 t). The most important exploited species in the north-eastern Atlantic are Eledone cirrhosa, Illex coindetii, Loligo forbesi, Loligo vulgaris, Octopus vulgaris, Todarodes sagittatus, Todaropsis eblanae and Sepia officinalis. Other species including Alloteuthis subulata, Gonatus fabricii and certain sepiolids, appear to be abundant and may be marketable. Cephalopods tend to rapidly concentrate heavy metals and other toxic substances in their tissues and this plays an important role in the bioaccumulation of these pollutants in marine predators as well as having implications for human consumption. High levels of cadmium and mercury are often recorded in cephalopod tissues. Another important environmental issue concerns the potential impact of widespread human activity on cephalopod spawning areas, particularly bottom-fishing operations but also shipping, and oil exploration and production. In contrast to many finfish species that spawn annually over a number of years, most cephalopods live only 1-2 yr and die after spawning. Therefore, failure to reproduce and recruit adequately in any given year may seriously impact the long-term viability of cephalopod stocks. Climate change is expected to have a significant effect on many species in the north-eastern Atlantic. This review provides a detailed account of the zoogeography, biology and ecology of cephalopods in the north-eastern Atlantic, on a species-by-species basis. Important economic, ecological and conservation issues affecting cephalopods in this area are also discussed.",,,,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85050916789,,0

Providing policymakers are receptive to these issues, public participation activities may be re-conceptualized as processes that illuminate policy problems relevant to a particular context, thereby promoting an agenda-setting role for the public. Originality/value – The paper offers an empirical analysis of public involvement in the case of sofosbuvir, where the relevant considerations that bear on priority-setting decisions have been particularly stark. The perspectives that emerge suggest that public participation contributes to raising attention to issues that need to be addressed by policymakers. Public participation activities can thus contribute to setting policy agendas, even if that is not their explicit purpose. However, the actualization of this contribution is contingent on the receptiveness of policymakers.","[""Antiviral Agents"",""Brazil"",""Community Participation"",""Decision Making"",""England"",""Health Care Rationing"",""Hepatitis C"",""Humans"",""Insurance Coverage"",""Insurance, Health"",""Republic of Korea"",""Sofosbuvir"",""United States""]","[""Agenda-setting"",""DAAs"",""Direct-acting antivirals"",""Hepatitis C"",""PPI"",""Priority-setting"",""Public and patient involvement"",""Sofosbuvir""]",10.1108/JHOM-03-2016-0035,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979943830,http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/137674/1/Journal_of_Health_Organization_and_Management_Pre_proof_draft.PDF,0

The aim of this study was to examine if non-psychotic psychiatric disorders (NPDs) were associated with future indicators of marginalisation and mortality. We also aimed to determine whether these associations might be mediated by education level and attenuated by high cognitive ability. Design: This is a prospective cohort study with baseline data from the Swedish Conscription register. Setting: The study was carried out in Sweden from 1969 to 2005. Participants: All of the participants were 18-year-old men at mandatory conscription in Sweden between 1969 and 2005 (n=1 609 690). Measures: NPDs were clinically diagnosed at conscription. Cognitive ability was measured by a standardised IQ test at conscription. National register data covered information on welfare support, long-term unemployment, disability pension (DP) and mortality over a period of 1-36 years. Results: NPD at the age of 18 years was a predictor of future welfare support, OR 3.73 (95% CI 3.65 to 3.80); long-term unemployment, OR 1.97 (95% CI 1.94 to 2.01); DP, HR 2.95 (95% CI 2.89 to 3.02); and mortality, HR 2.45 (2.33-2.52). The adjusted models suggested that these associations were not confounded by fathers' educational level, cognitive ability had only a minor attenuating effect on most associations and the mediating effect of own educational level was small. Conclusions: The present study underlines a higher prevalence of future adversities in young men experiencing NPDs at the age of 18 years. It also indicates that higher cognitive ability may work as a potential resilience factor against future marginalisation and mortality.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Anxiety Disorders"",""Cognition"",""Cohort Studies"",""Depressive Disorder"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""Humans"",""Intelligence"",""Intelligence Tests"",""Logistic Models"",""Male"",""Men"",""Mental Disorders"",""Middle Aged"",""Mortality"",""Odds Ratio"",""Pensions"",""Personality Disorders"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Prospective Studies"",""Public Assistance"",""Resilience, Psychological"",""Social Marginalization"",""Social Security"",""Substance-Related Disorders"",""Sweden"",""Unemployment"",""Young Adult""]","[""Epidemiology"",""Mental Health""]",10.1136/bmjopen-2015-010769,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982300728,https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/6/8/e010769.full.pdf,0

All rights reserved.The United Nations listed maternal mortality as a major problem especially in developing countries. Predictive models that predict pregnancy complications have been suggested as an intervention to reduce maternal mortality but at the moment, many are not used in clinical practice. This study proposes a service-dominant perspective as an alternative use of predictive models to create value for maternal healthcare. We conducted an exploratory study in south-eastern Uganda in which we held semi-structured interviews with health practitioners to understand how the maternal healthcare system in Uganda works and how pregnancy complications are predicted. Results were analyzed using components from the service innovation framework. We find that overall, ICT has not been fully exploited to improve access to quality care, improve predictions and to improve collaboration among different practitioners in Uganda. Our findings suggest that by adapting a service-dominant perspective, we can enable predictive models and other technologies to assume an active role in maternal healthcare thereby supporting health practitioners with different skills and knowledge to predict pregnancy complications and hence trigger collaborative value creation. We believe that such an intervention will reduce maternal mortality.","[""Exploratory studies"",""Health-care system"",""Maternal mortality"",""Predictive models"",""Pregnancy complications"",""Semi structured interviews"",""Service innovation"",""Service-dominant Logic""]","[""Maternal healthcare"",""Predictive models"",""Pregnancy complications"",""Service-dominant logic""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058054761,,0

However, the systematics of this family remains poorly understood since no modern phylogenetic study has been undertaken to support any of the proposed classifications. The present study is the first molecular phylogeny of Tergipedidae based on partial sequences of two mitochondrial (COI and 16S) genes and one nuclear gene (H3). Maximum likelihood, maximum parsimony and Bayesian analysis were conducted in order to elucidate the systematics of this family. Our results do not recover the traditional Tergipedidae as monophyletic, since it belongs to a larger clade that includes the families Eubranchidae, Fionidae and Calmidae. This newly recovered clade is here referred to as Fionidae, the oldest name for this taxon. In addition, the present molecular phylogeny does not recover the traditional systematic relationships at a generic level, and therefore, systematic changes are required. We recognize the following clades within Fionidae: Calma, Cuthona, Cuthonella, Eubranchus, Fiona, Murmania, Tenellia, Tergipes, Tergiposacca gen. nov., Rubramoena gen. nov. and Abronica gen. nov. The type species of Tergiposacca, T. longicerata nov. sp. is described. The other two new genera have a previously described species as their type species. Most of these taxa, with the exceptions of Eubranchus, Tergipes and Fiona are composed of radically different constituent species from their traditional membership, but appear to be supported by morphological synapomorphies as well as molecular data. Aenigmastyletus, Catriona, Phestilla, Tenellia and Trinchesia are nested within other clades and, thus are here considered as synonyms of the larger clades.

Tetracyclines comprise an antibiotic class of great importance to both human and animal health. Accordingly, residues of tetracycline are commonly detected in aquatic environments. To assess if tetracycline pollution in aquatic environments promotes development of resistance, we determined minimal selective concentrations (MSCs) in biofilms of complex aquatic bacterial communities using both phenotypic and genotypic assays. Tetracycline significantly increased the relative abundance of resistant bacteria at 10 μg/L, while specific tet genes (tetA and tetG) increased significantly at the lowest concentration tested (1 μg/L). Taxonomic composition of the biofilm communities was altered with increasing tetracycline concentrations. Metagenomic analysis revealed a concurrent increase of several tet genes and a range of other genes providing resistance to different classes of antibiotics (e.g. cmlA, floR, sul1, and mphA), indicating potential for co-selection. Consequently, MSCs for the tet genes of ≤. 1 μg/L suggests that current exposure levels in e.g. sewage treatment plants could be sufficient to promote resistance. The methodology used here to assess MSCs could be applied in risk assessment of other antibiotics as well.","[""Antibiotic contaminants"",""Antibiotic resistance"",""Antibiotic resistance genes"",""Antibiotic-resistant bacteria"",""Environmental emissions"",""Metagenomic analysis"",""Selective concentration"",""Taxonomic composition"",""Bacteria"",""Biofilms"",""Drug Resistance, Microbial"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Tetracycline"",""Tetracycline Resistance"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Antibiotic contaminants"",""Antibiotic resistance"",""Environmental emission limits"",""Minimal selective concentration"",""Risk assessment""]",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.02.103,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960875881,http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/234981/local_234981.pdf,0

This crystallised an ambition first enshrined in law over five decades earlier, but never previously realised. This paper explores Indonesia's journey towards universal health coverage (UHC) from independence to the launch of a comprehensive health insurance scheme in January 2014. We find that Indonesia's path has been determined largely by domestic political concerns - different groups obtained access to healthcare as their socio-political importance grew. A major inflection point occurred following the Asian financial crisis of 1997. To stave off social unrest, the government provided health coverage for the poor for the first time, creating a path dependency that influenced later policy choices. The end of this programme coincided with decentralisation, leading to experimentation with several different models of health provision at the local level. When direct elections for local leaders were introduced in 2005, popular health schemes led to success at the polls. UHC became an electoral asset, moving up the political agenda. It also became contested, with national policy-makers appropriating health insurance programmes that were first developed locally, and taking credit for them. The Indonesian experience underlines the value of policy experimentation, and of a close understanding of the contextual and political factors that drive successful UHC models at the local level. Specific drivers of success and failure should be taken into account when scaling UHC to the national level. In the Indonesian example, UHC became possible when the interests of politically and economically influential groups were either satisfied or neutralised. While technical considerations took a back seat to political priorities in developing the structures for health coverage nationally, they will have to be addressed going forward to achieve sustainable UHC in Indonesia.","[""Health Policy"",""Healthcare Financing"",""Humans"",""Indonesia"",""Insurance, Health"",""Politics"",""Universal Coverage""]","[""Decentralisation"",""Experimentalist governance"",""Health financing"",""Health insurance"",""Indonesia"",""Path dependence"",""Social protection"",""Universal Health Coverage""]",10.1093/heapol/czw120,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019714510,https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article-pdf/32/2/267/10478148/czw120.pdf,0

In this study, ground-based measurements of surface elevation and ice depth are combined with terrestrial photogrammetry, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite elevation models to derive the surface mass balance of the debris-covered tongue of Changri Nup Glacier, located in the Everest region. Over the debris-covered tongue, the mean elevation change between 2011 and 2015 is -0.93 m year-1 or -0.84 m water equivalent per year (w.e. a-1). The mean emergence velocity over this region, estimated from the total ice flux through a cross section immediately above the debris-covered zone, is +0.37 m w.e. a-1. The debris-covered portion of the glacier thus has an area-averaged mass balance of -1.21 ± 0.2 m w.e. a-1 between 5240 and 5525 m above sea level (m a.s.l.). Surface mass balances observed on nearby debris-free glaciers suggest that the ablation is strongly reduced (by ca. 1.8 m w.e. a-1) by the debris cover.

By looking at these opinions (satisfaction versus dissatisfaction) in relation to certain features of internships as well as to the more general labour market regulatory framework, this project aims to give a voice to young people, enabling them (indirectly) to provide policy suggestions to law-makers. Furthermore, we propose a preview of a possible empirical model for data collection based on the manual coding of Tweets. By employing a Probit regression and Blinder-Oaxaca and Fairlie decompositions, we have tried to establish a link between the perceived evaluation of internships and the country where the internship is based, the latter being used as a proxy for the legal system. In all our tests we found that the country in which the internship is placed is the main factor in the positive or negative perception. We also find that the more difficult is to hire a young worker on a temporary basis the lower will be his valuation of the internship experience. Ultimately we propose the use of Twitter not only as a relevant research tool, but also as an instrument for bringing young people's needs to the attention of law-makers.","[""Data collection"",""Empirical model"",""Internships"",""Labour market"",""Legislative process"",""Policy suggestions"",""Regulatory frameworks"",""Twitter""]","[""Employment protection legislation"",""Internships"",""Labour market institutions"",""Twitter"",""Youth employment""]",10.1016/j.chb.2016.02.083,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959518328,http://amsacta.unibo.it/4175/1/WP995.pdf,0

They are often suggested to be biodiversity and biomass hotspots, although there is no consensus about this in the literature. Nevertheless, many canyons do host diverse faunal communities but owing to our lack of understanding of the processes shaping and driving this diversity, appropriate management strategies have yet to be developed. Here, we integrate all the current knowledge of one single system, the Whittard Canyon (Celtic Margin, NE Atlantic), including the latest research on its geology, sedimentology, geomorphology, oceanography, ecology, and biodiversity in order to address this issue. The Whittard Canyon is an active system in terms of sediment transport. The net suspended sediment transport is mainly up-canyon causing sedimentary overflow in some upper canyon areas. Occasionally sediment gravity flow events do occur, some possibly the result of anthropogenic activity. However, the role of these intermittent gravity flows in transferring labile organic matter to the deeper regions of the canyon appears to be limited. More likely, any labile organic matter flushed downslope in this way becomes strongly diluted with bulk material and is therefore of little food value for benthic fauna. Instead, the fresh organic matter found in the Whittard Channel mainly arrives through vertical deposition and lateral transport of phytoplankton blooms that occur in the area during spring and summer. The response of the Whittard Canyon fauna to these processes is different in different groups. Foraminiferal abundances are higher in the upper parts of the canyon and on the slope than in the lower canyon. Meiofaunal abundances in the upper and middle part of the canyon are higher than on adjacent slopes, but lower in the deepest part. Mega- and macrofauna abundances are higher in the canyon compared with the adjacent slope and are higher in the eastern than the western branch. These faunal patterns reflect the fact that the Whittard Canyon encompasses considerable environmental heterogeneity, related to a combination of organic matter trapping, current regimes (due to focused internal tides) and different substrates. We conclude that coordinated observations of processes driving faunal patterns are needed at a fine scale in order to understand the functioning of communities in this and other submarine canyons.","[""Anthropogenic activity"",""Coordinated observations"",""Different substrates"",""Environmental heterogeneity"",""Labile organic matter"",""Management strategies"",""Sediment gravity flow"",""Vertical depositions""]",,10.1016/j.pocean.2016.06.003,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978962212,http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/id/eprint/513768/1/Amaro_et_al_2016_The%20Whittard%20Canyon%20review%20paper.pdf,0

In previous research, two opposing views are put forward with regards to the relationship between corruption and turnout. On the one hand, corruption increases turnout because voters either are bought off to participate or because they are mobilized on clean government issues. On the other hand, corruption decreases turnout because presence of corruption corrodes the political system which leads to general cynicism, distrust and voter apathy. In this paper, we contribute to the existing research by adopting a multi-level approach to the relationship between corruption and turnout. We test the hypothesis that voters’ perceptions of corruption dampens turnout but that the effect is conditional upon the corruption context. We test our hypothesis by combining individual-level data and country-level data from 26 countries from the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems and country-level data from the Quality of Government Data Set.

For example, during the middle stages of Marine Isotope Stage 3, published estimates of peak global mean sea level (GMSL) relative to the present range from −25 m to −87 m. The large uncertainty in GMSL at MIS 3 has significant implications for estimates of the rate of ice growth in the period leading to the Last Glacial Maximum (∼26 ka). We refine estimates of global ice volume during MIS 3 by employing sediment cores in the Bohai and Yellow Sea that record a migration of the paleoshoreline at ∼50–37 ka through a transition from marine to brackish conditions. In particular, we correct relative sea level at these sites for contamination due to glacial isostatic adjustment using a sea-level calculation that includes a gravitationally self-consistent treatment of sediment redistribution and compaction, and estimate a peak global mean sea level of −38 ± 7 m during the interval 50–37 ka.

With a detailed case study of Nepal’s community forestry and REDD+ processes, this paper analyses whether and how the ideas of justice are applied in forest governance. In particular, it assesses justice implications of policy processes and outcomes, including the Forest Act (1993), Forestry Sector Strategy (2014), Forest Policy (2015), and REDD+ Strategy (First Draft, 2015) and discusses the opportunities and challenges of addressing issues of justice and forest peoples’ rights through community forestry and REDD+ in Nepal. In so doing, this paper also draws some useful insights on how to link twin agendas of justice and sustainability in forest management.",,"[""Community Forestry"",""Forest Policy"",""Justice"",""Nepal"",""REDD+"",""Rights""]",10.18848/1832-2077/CGP(Journal),https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85054008460,,0

In this study, we integrated deliberative monetary valuation, storytelling, subjective well-being and psychometric approaches to comprehensively elicit cultural ecosystem service values for proposed UK marine protected areas. We elicit and compare five valuation stages: individual values from an online survey; individual and group values following deliberation on information in workshops; and individual and group values following storytelling and a ‘transcendental values compass’ deliberation. Deliberated group values significantly differed from non-deliberated individual values, with reduced willingness to pay and increased convergence with subjective wellbeing; deliberated individual values fell between the two. Storytelling played an important role in revealing values that were previously implicit. Participants were more confident about values elicited in the workshops than the online survey and felt that deliberated values should be used in decision-making. The results of this study (albeit with a limited sample size) suggest that shared values may be a better reflection of welfare implications than non-deliberated individual values, while at the same time more reflective of participants' transcendental values: their broader life goals and principles.",,"[""Cultural ecosystem services"",""Deliberative monetary valuation"",""Fair price"",""Integrated valuation"",""Interpretive methods"",""Transcendental values""]",10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.06.006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007560540,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoser.2016.06.006,0

All rights reserved.Importance: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a devastating complication of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The retina is rich in long-chain ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCω3PUFAs), which are substrate for oxylipins with anti-inflammatory and antiangiogenic properties. Experimental models support dietary LCω3PUFA protection against DR, but clinical data are lacking. Objective: To determine whether LCω3PUFA intake relates to a decreased incidence of sight-threatening DR in individuals with type 2 diabetes older than 55 years. Design, Setting, and Participants: In late 2015, we conceived a prospective study within the randomized clinical trial Prevención con Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED), testing Mediterranean diets supplemented with extra virgin olive oil or nuts vs a control diet for primary cardiovascular prevention. The trial was conducted in primary health care centers in Spain. From 2003 to 2009, 3614 individuals aged 55 to 80 years with a previous diagnosis of type 2 diabetes were recruited. Full data were available for 3482 participants (48%men; mean age 67 years). Exposures: Meeting the dietary LCω3PUFA recommendation of at least 500mg/d for primary cardiovascular prevention, as assessed by a validated food-frequency questionnaire. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcomewas incident DR requiring laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy, and/or antiangiogenic therapy confirmed by an external adjudication committee. Results: Of the 3482 participants, 48%were men and the mean age was 67 years. A total of 2611 participants (75%)met target LCω3PUFA recommendation. During a median follow-up of 6 years, we documented 69 new events. After adjusting for age, sex, intervention group, and lifestyle and clinical variables, participants meeting the LCω3PUFA recommendation at baseline (≥500mg/d) compared with those not fulfilling this recommendation (<500mg/d) showed a 48%relatively reduced risk of incident sight-threatening DR, with a hazard ratio of 0.52 (95%CI, 0.31-0.88; P = .001). This association was slightly stronger for yearly updated LCω3PUFA intake (relative risk, 0.48; 95%CI, 0.28-0.82; P = .007). Conclusions and Relevance: In middle-aged and older individuals with type 2 diabetes, intake of at least 500mg/d of dietary LCω3PUFA, easily achievable with 2 weekly servings of oily fish, is associated with a decreased risk of sight-threatening DR. Our results concur with findings from experimental models and the current model of DR pathogenesis.","[""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2"",""Diabetic Retinopathy"",""Dietary Supplements"",""Fatty Acids, Omega-3"",""Female"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""Humans"",""Incidence"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Prospective Studies"",""Risk Assessment"",""Risk Factors"",""Seafood"",""Spain"",""Time Factors"",""Treatment Outcome""]",,10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2016.2906,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84997402815,https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/articlepdf/2543478/eoi160065.pdf,0

For a decentralization of catalytic ammonia production, small-scale N2 reduction devices are required that are equipped with the most stable, selective, and active catalysts that operate at low temperature and ambient pressure. Here, we report the development of new and cost-efficient catalysts, transition metal nitrides, which enable electrochemical reduction of molecular nitrogen to ammonia in aqueous media at ambient conditions with only a low applied bias. The most promising catalysts are VN, ZrN, NbN, and CrN, which are identified among a range of transition metal nitride surfaces through a comprehensive density functional theory based analysis. All four nitrides are found to be more active toward nitrogen reduction than toward the competing hydrogen evolution reaction, in contrast to pure metal catalysts, which largely evolve hydrogen. Furthermore, their stability against poisoning and possible decomposition under operating conditions is also studied. Particular single-crystal surfaces are needed for ZrN, NbN, and CrN because polycrystalline surfaces may result in decomposition of the whole catalyst. Polycrystalline surfaces of VN may, however, be used since the rocksalt (100) facet is predicted to produce ammonia via a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism with only a0.5 V overpotential, thereby avoiding decomposition. We suggest that this is a promising step toward the development of a method for synthesizing ammonia cheaply, to prepare high-value-added nitrogenous compounds directly from air, water, and electricity at ambient conditions. An additional benefit to the present analysis is that the method used in this work may be applicable to other aqueous phase catalytic reactions, where a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism is operative and product selectivity and activity are key catalytic criteria.","[""Electro reduction"",""Electrochemical reductions"",""Electrochemical synthesis"",""Hydrogen evolution reactions"",""Hydrogen storage medium"",""Mars-van krevelen mechanisms"",""Polycrystalline surface"",""Transition metal nitrides""]","[""density functional theory calculations"",""electrocatalysis"",""electrochemical synthesis of ammonia"",""electroreduction of nitrogen to ammonia"",""transition metal nitride catalysts""]",10.1021/acscatal.5b01918,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957578747,,0

Now, the Commission recommends an integrated approach for the protection against radon exposure in all buildings irrespective of their purpose and the status of their occupants. The strategy of protection in buildings, implemented through a national action plan, is based on the application of the optimisation principle below a derived reference level in concentration (maximum 300 Bq m−3). A problem, however, arises that due to new epidemiological findings and application of dosimetric models, ICRP 115 (Ann ICRP 40, 2010) presents nominal probability coefficients for radon exposure that are approximately by a factor of 2 larger than in the former recommendations of ICRP 65 (Ann ICRP 23, 1993). On the basis of the so-called epidemiological approach and the dosimetric approach, the doubling of risk per unit exposure is represented by a doubling of the dose coefficients, while the risk coefficient of ICRP 103 (2007) remains unchanged. Thus, an identical given radon exposure situation with the new dose coefficients would result in a doubling of dose compared with the former values. This is of serious conceptual implications. A possible solution of this problem was presented during the workshop.","[""Dose coefficients"",""Dose conversion factor"",""Dosimetric models"",""Integrated approach"",""Lung Cancer"",""Radon exposure"",""Reference levels"",""Risk coefficient"",""Air Pollutants, Radioactive"",""Humans"",""Radiation Dosage"",""Radiation Exposure"",""Radiation Protection"",""Radon"",""Risk""]","[""Dose conversion factor"",""Lung cancer"",""Radon""]",10.1007/s00411-016-0657-2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975481495,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00411-016-0657-2.pdf,0

For this mean, a novel biofilm model including soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) was developed to explain kinetics and abundance of independent microbial groups in terms of relative biovolume fraction and the spatial localization of bacteria in biofilm layers. The model was calibrated, validated and the model accuracy was checked using measured total nitrogen concentration and microbial biovolume fractions. For estimation of biovolume fraction an innovative enhanced protocol for quantitative fluorescence in-situ hybridization (qFISH), in-situ microscopy and digital image analysis for the cultivation-independent microorganisms was established. The model with EPS kinetics fits better for the bacteria groups of anammox bacteria, AOB and NOB compared to the model without EPS. Real-time producing BAP and UAP is simulated and it was presumed that he growth and existence of heterotrophs in anammox biofilm systems increase due to considering the autotrophic production of SMP.","[""Anaerobic ammonium oxidation"",""Anaerobic granular biofilm"",""Digital image analysis"",""Extracellular polymeric substances"",""Fluorescence in situ hybridization"",""Granular activated carbons"",""Microbial soluble products"",""Soluble microbial products""]","[""Denitrification"",""Granular biofilm"",""Microbial soluble products"",""Population dynamics modelling"",""Quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox)""]",10.1007/978-3-319-58421-8_92,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029170758,,0

Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.Projections of marine biodiversity and implementation of effective actions for its maintenance in the face of current rapid global environmental change are constrained by our limited understanding of species’ adaptive responses, including transgenerational plasticity, epigenetics and natural selection. This special issue presents 13 novel studies, which employ experimental and modelling approaches to (i) investigate plastic and evolutionary responses of marine species to major global change drivers; (ii) ask relevant broad eco-evolutionary questions, implementing multiple species and populations studies; (iii) show the advantages of using advanced experimental designs and tools; (iv) construct novel model organisms for marine evolution; (v) help identifying future challenges for the field; and (vi) highlight the importance of incorporating existing evolutionary theory into management solutions for the marine realm. What emerges is that at least some populations of marine species have the ability to adapt to future global change conditions. However, marine organisms’ capacity for adaptation appears finite, due to evolutionary trade-offs and possible rapid losses in genetic diversity. This further corroborates the idea that acquiring an evolutionary perspective on how marine life will respond to the selective pressure of future global changes will guide us in better identifying which conservation efforts will be most needed and most effective.",,"[""common garden experiment"",""DNA methylation"",""epigenetics"",""evolutionary modeling"",""local adaptation"",""marine evolution"",""ocean acidification"",""ocean warming"",""phenotypic plasticity"",""rapid adaptation"",""salinity"",""transgenerational responses""]",10.1111/eva.12418,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988877885,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/eva.12418,0

All rights reserved.Inflammatory joint disorders (IJD), including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (ASp) and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), are prevalent conditions worldwide with a considerable burden on healthcare systems. IJD are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) disease-related morbidity and mortality. In this review, we present an overview of the literature. Standardised mortality ratios are increased in IJD compared with the general population, that is, RA 1.3-2.3, ASp 1.6-1.9 and PsA 0.8-1.6. This premature mortality is mainly caused by atherosclerotic events. In RA, this CV risk is comparable to that in type 2 diabetes. Traditional CV risk factors are more often present and partially a consequence of changes in physical function related to the underlying IJD. Also, chronic systemic inflammation itself is an independent CV risk factor. Optimal control of disease activity with conventional synthetic, targeted synthetic and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs decreases this excess risk. High-grade inflammation as well as anti-inflammatory treatment alter traditional CV risk factors, such as lipids. In view of the above-mentioned CV burden in patients with IJD, CV risk management is necessary. Presently, this CV risk management is still lacking in usual care. Patients, general practitioners, cardiologists, internists and rheumatologists need to be aware of the substantially increased CV risk in IJD and should make a combined effort to timely initiate CV risk management in accordance with prevailing guidelines together with optimal control of rheumatic disease activity. CV screening and treatment strategies need to be implemented in usual care.","[""Anti-Inflammatory Agents"",""Arthritis"",""Atherosclerosis"",""Chronic Disease"",""Humans"",""Prevalence"",""Prognosis"",""Protective Factors"",""Risk Assessment"",""Risk Factors"",""Risk Reduction Behavior""]",,10.1136/heartjnl-2015-307838,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959449963,,0

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background Septic arthritis is a serious joint disease often caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (RAGE) has an important role in several infections. We sought to investigate the role of RAGE in staphylococcal septic arthritis and sepsis in mice. Methods Wild-type (WT) and RAGE deficient (RAGE-/-) mice were intra-articularly or intravenously inoculated with an arthritic or septic dose of S. aureus LS-1 strain. Clinical arthritis, weight development and mortality were monitored for 14 days. Serum levels of cytokines, kidney bacterial loads as well as micro-CT and histopathology of the joints were assessed. Results RAGE-/- mice with septic arthritis had significantly lower IL-17A and higher bone mineral density (BMD) compared to the control group. However, no significant differences between the groups were observed regarding the weight loss, the severity and frequency of arthritis, and bacterial loads in the kidneys. In mice with sepsis, the overall mortality rate was similar in RAGE-/- (39%) and in WT mice (45%). However, RAGE-/- mice with sepsis had significantly higher bacterial load in their kidneys compared to the WT controls. In line with data from hematogenous S. aureus arthritis, RAGE deficiency had no impact on arthritis severity in local joint infection. Conclusions Our results indicate that lack of RAGE has no significant impact on septic arthritis. However, RAGE-/- mice had significantly higher BMD compared to WT mice, which coincided with lower IL-17A in RAGE-/- mice.

In the current paper we report the results of an experiment conducted in two European countries—Denmark and Italy—different for food culture and familiarity with the topic of eating insects. We investigated the possibility to foster people's willingness to eat insect-based food through communication, also comparing messages based on individual vs. societal benefits of the eating of insects. Communication proved to be effective on intention and behaviour, and the societal message appeared to be more robust over time. The communication effect is significant across nation, gender, and previous knowledge about the topic. In addition, we investigated the impact of non-conscious negative associations with insects on the choice to eat vs. not eat insect-based food.

This is due to the divergence between morphological area structures and data attribution, which is generally available at the level of administrative units. Most existing experiences focus on small regions or use indirect data, from which only indirect information can be derived. This paper proposes an identification of urban settlements in the European Union space, which combines urban population and shape through geographic information system (GIS) techniques. For that purpose, 1 km2 cells with associated population data are used. A procedure is developed establishing three different types of urban settlements, according to population and population density values: high-density urban clusters, small and medium-sized towns, and very small towns. A validation of this procedure is performed using direct survey from local experts in 10 selected study areas. The final results show that 78,307 urban settlements can be identified: 88.17% of them are classified as “very small towns,” 10.75% as “small and medium-sized towns,” and 1.08% as high-density urban clusters.

We have previously shown that farming mothers consume more full-fat dairy than control mothers, who instead consume more low-fat dairy, margarine, and oils; margarine and oil intake was associated with increased risk of allergy development in their children. Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate the differences in diet between children in farming and control families at 1 year of age, to investigate the relation between the diets of the mothers and their children, and to relate the children's diet to allergy development. Design: The diet of 1-year-old children from dairy farming families (n = 28) and from control families in the same rural area (n = 37) was assessed by 24-h dietary recalls, followed by 24-h food diaries. Allergy was diagnosed by pediatricians at 3 years of age using strict predefined criteria. Results: Farm children had a higher intake of farm milk, whole cream, cholesterol, saturated fat, and fat in total and tended to eat more butter, while controls consumed more carbohydrates and poultry and tended to eat more margarine. Farm children also had higher intakes of homemade porridge/gruel, oily fish, and iodine. The intake of butter and whole milk in children and mothers correlated significantly in farm families but not in controls. A weak negative association was found between seafood intake and allergy development, while allergy was positively associated with the intake of pork as well as zinc in the control group; these intakes also correlated with each other. Conclusions: Consistent with mothers in farming families, the children consumed more full-fat dairy and saturated fat than did controls, but this could not be linked to the low risk of allergy in the farming group. Seafood intake might protect against allergy development, in accordance with earlier findings.",,"[""Atopy"",""Dairy farm"",""Dietary patterns"",""Fatty acids"",""Infants""]",10.3402/fnr.v60.32721,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990989596,https://foodandnutritionresearch.net/index.php/fnr/article/download/993/3800,0

A case study of deer management in Scotland,"© 2016 The AuthorsMonitoring is one of the key tools employed to help understand the condition of the natural environment and inform the development of appropriate management actions. While international conventions encourage the use of standardised methods, the link between the information monitoring provides and local management needs is frequently overlooked. This problem is further exacerbated when monitoring is employed in areas where there are divergent interests among stakeholders in land use and management. Such problems are found in the management of wild deer across Scotland, where monitoring, in the form of habitat impact assessments, have been introduced as an innovation in sustainable deer management. However, the uptake of habitat impact assessments has been limited. We used deer management in Scotland as a case study to explore whether reinventing habitat impact assessments, and hosting the system on a familiar digital platform (a mobile phone) could help to remove perceived barriers to the implementation of assessments. Using the diffusion of innovations as a theoretical framework three sets of workshops were conducted with participants representing different stakeholder interests. While the proposed digital system did address perceived barriers to the conduct of habitat monitoring, in addition it revealed underlying concerns on the use and purpose of habitat monitoring as a tool in land management. Such concerns indicate friction between scientific and management perspectives, which need to be considered and addressed if monitoring is to become more widely acceptable as a tool to inform the management of natural resources.","[""Animal Culling"",""Animals"",""Conservation of Natural Resources"",""Cooperative Behavior"",""Deer"",""Ecosystem"",""Humans"",""Scotland""]","[""Deer management"",""Habitat monitoring"",""Innovation"",""Natural resource management"",""Reinvention""]",10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.074,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994008598,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.09.074,0

Smoking behaviour is influenced by many factors, including the role of women’s significant others (SOs) and support from health-care professionals (HPs). Objectives To enhance understanding of the barriers to, and facilitators of, smoking cessation and the feasibility and acceptability of interventions to reach and support pregnant women to stop smoking. Design Four parts: (1) a description of interventions in the UK for smoking cessation in pregnancy; (2) three systematic reviews (syntheses) of qualitative research of women’s, SOs’ and HPs’ views of smoking in pregnancy using meta-ethnography (interpretative approach for combining findings); (3) semistructured interviews with pregnant women, SOs and HPs, guided by the social-ecological framework (conceptualises behaviour as an outcome of individuals’ interactions with environment); and (4) identification of new/improved interventions for future testing. Setting Studies in reviews conducted in high-income countries. Qualitative research was conducted from October 2013 to December 2014 in two mixed urban/rural study sites: area A (Scotland) and area B (England). Participants Thirty-eight studies (1100 pregnant women) in 42 papers, nine studies (150 partners) in 14 papers and eight studies described in nine papers (190 HPs) included in reviews. Forty-one interviews with pregnant women, 32 interviews with pregnant women’s SOs and 28 individual/group interviews with 48 HPs were conducted. Main outcome measures The perceived barriers to, and facilitators of, smoking cessation in pregnancy and the identification of potential new/modified interventions. Results Syntheses identified smoking-related perceptions and experiences for pregnant women and SOs that were fluid and context dependent with the capacity to help or hinder smoking cessation. Themes were analysed in accordance with the social-ecological framework levels. From the analysis of the interviews, the themes that were central to cessation in pregnancy at an individual level, and that reflected the findings from the reviews, were perception of risk to baby, self-efficacy, influence of close relationships and smoking as a way of coping with stress. Overall, pregnant smokers were faced with more barriers than facilitators. At an interpersonal level, partners’ emotional and practical support, willingness to change smoking behaviour and role of smoking within relationships were important. Across the review and interviews of HPs, education to enhance knowledge and confidence in delivering information about smoking in pregnancy and the centrality of the client relationship, protection of which could be a factor in downplaying risks, were important. HPs acknowledged that they could best assist by providing support and understanding, and access to effective interventions, including an opt-out referral pathway to Stop Smoking Services, routine carbon monoxide screening, behavioural support and access to pharmacotherapy. Additional themes at community, organisational and societal levels were also identified. Limitations Limitations include a design grounded in qualitative studies, difficulties recruiting SOs, and local service configurations and recruitment processes that potentially skewed the sample. Conclusions Perceptions and experiences of barriers to and facilitators of smoking cessation in pregnancy are fluid and context dependent. Effective interventions for smoking cessation in pregnancy should take account of the interplay between the individual, interpersonal and environmental aspects of women’s lives.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Female"",""Health Behavior"",""Health Personnel"",""Humans"",""Interpersonal Relations"",""Interviews as Topic"",""Pregnancy"",""Pregnant Women"",""Professional Role"",""Self Efficacy"",""Smoking"",""Smoking Cessation"",""Social Support"",""Socioeconomic Factors"",""United Kingdom"",""Young Adult""]",,10.3310/hta21360,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85021909245,https://njl-admin.nihr.ac.uk/document/download/2010633,0

All Rights Reserved.Dishonesty is ubiquitous in our world. The news is frequently filled with high-profile cases of corporate fraud, large-scale corruption, lying politicians, and the hypocrisy of public figures. On a smaller scale, ordinary people often cheat, lie, misreport their taxes, and mislead others in their daily life. Despite such prevalence of cheating, corruption, and concealment, people typically consider themselves to be honest, and often believe themselves to be more moral than most others. This book aims to resolve this paradox by addressing the question of why people are dishonest all too often. What motivates dishonesty, and how are people able to perceive themselves as moral despite their dishonest behaviour? What personality and interpersonal factors make dishonesty more likely? And what can be done to recognise and reduce dishonesty? This is a fascinating overview of state-of-the-art research on dishonesty, with prominent scholars offering their views to clarify the roots of dishonesty. Expanding and complementing previous macro-level approaches of corruption in the world, this volume focuses on the micro-level process of how people commit, and justify, their own dishonest behaviour. Addresses a broad range of individual and social factors that influence the likelihood of dishonest behaviour. Provides tools for practitioners on how to reduce the likelihood of dishonesty, and how to detect if people are lying.",,,10.1017/CBO9781316225608,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048612529,,0

Raw sensor data and aggregated information are spread among the network and processed in multiple nodes to result in an action, which is possibly executed at a different physical location in the network. Due to the flexible topology and the emergent features of CPS, decisions within the network that trigger actions are not always trivial to understand. These decisions are based on raw sensor data which are not clearly visible at the location of their execution. This can be problematic if decisions have to be justifiable. It becomes even more difficult if decisions has been flawed, and it is not ascertainable why they were made. In order to determine the reasons for incorrect decisions in the network, the dependencies and input values of a decision must be known. Without this information, debugging is quite difficult.

The risk of postoperative pulmonary complications is high and therefore standard postoperative care involves respiratory physiotherapy. The purpose of this systematic review is to create an overview of the evidence on respiratory physiotherapy after lung resection surgery on mortality rate (within 30 days) and postoperative pulmonary complications. Methods and analysis The review will include randomized or quasi-randomized controlled studies investigating the effect of all types of respiratory physiotherapy on mortality and postoperative pulmonary complications after lung resection surgery. Furthermore, the effect of respiratory physiotherapy is evaluated on secondary outcomes such as length of hospital stay, lung volumes and function, and adverse events. The method of the planned review is described in this paper. The literature search will include the databases PubMed, Cochrane (Central), Embase, Cinahl and PEDro.

Vegetated field margins can mitigate negative impacts of soil erosion off-site by trapping eroded material. Here we analyse how local management affects the trapping capacity of field margins in a monsoon region of South Korea, contrasting intensively and extensively managed field margins on both steep and shallow slopes. Prior to the beginning of monsoon season, we equipped a total of 12 sites representing three replicates for each of four different types of field margins (""intensive managed flat"", ""intensive managed steep"", ""extensive managed flat"" and ""extensive managed steep"") with Astroturf mats. The mats (n = 15/site) were placed before, within and after the field margin. Sediment was collected after each rain event until the end of the monsoon season.The effect of management and slope on sediment trapping was analysed using linear mixed effects models, using as response variable either the sediment collected within the field margin or the difference in sediment collected after and before the field margin.There was no difference in the amount of sediment reaching the different field margin types. In contrast, extensively managed field margins showed a large reduction in collected sediment before and after the field margins. This effect was pronounced in steep field margins, and increased with the size of rainfall events. We conclude that a field margin management promoting a dense vegetation cover is a key to mitigating negative off-site effects of soil erosion in monsoon regions, particularly in field margins with steep slopes.","[""Agriculture"",""Environment"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Rain"",""Republic of Korea"",""Seasons"",""Soil""]","[""Agricultural landscape"",""Field margins"",""Management"",""Sediment retention"",""Slope"",""Soil erosion""]",10.1016/j.jenvman.2015.12.031,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84952838158,,0

In this context, also some interest in thermal energy storages, especially in a concept called pumped heat electricity storage (PHES), arises. One possible design of such a PHES system consists of a compression heat pump, a thermal storage and an organic Rankine cycle (ORC). The present work analyses the general thermodynamic potential and limits of such a system and deals with the unusual requirements for the ORC. The potential analysis starts with the optimal case of combining two Carnot cycles with irreversible heat transfer. It is found that the efficiency of the entire process increases with increasing storage temperature and in general roundtrip efficiencies up to 70 % are predicted. Afterwards the cycles are transferred to cycles that are more realistic by considering technical aspects and a hypothetical working fluid which is optimized by an inverse engineering approach. This leads to lowered roundtrip efficiencies, which now, decrease with increasing storage temperatures. In a second step the specific ORC requirements as part of a PHES are considered, emphasizing the working fluid parameters. Especially, the use of a latent thermal energy storage leads to an ORC design differing from common (e.g. geothermal) applications. It is shown that the efficiency of the ORC and of the entire process strongly depends on the superheating at the expander inlet; here, the superheating must be held as small as possible, contrary to ORCs using common heat sources.","[""Electricity storages"",""Energy storage capacity"",""Inverse engineering"",""Latent thermal energy storages"",""Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC)"",""Renewable energy source"",""Reversible thermodynamics"",""Thermodynamic potentials""]","[""endo-reversible thermodynamics"",""fluid selection"",""inverse engineering"",""pumped electricity heat storage""]",10.1016/j.egypro.2017.09.235,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029761599,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2017.09.235,0

Photosynthetic microorganisms, e.g. microalgae, are good candidates for this challenging bet. The culture performances remarkably reduce when microalgal cultures move from laboratory to industrial scale. The basic requisite for the development of large-scale production of oil from microalgae is to make the process environmentally and economically sustainable/feasible. A key issue for the process based on outdoor photobioreactors (PBR) is the efficient utilization of the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). The present work reports the results of outdoor cultures of Scenedesmus vacuolatus strain ACUF 053/95 in 1.7 L inclined bubble column (IBC) photobioreactors characterized by 250 cm2 irradiated surface.

Data acquired from large registry-based studies revealed an increase in mortality rates among KS patients when compared with mortality rates among the general population. Among all causes of death, metabolic, cardiovascular, and hemostatic complication seem to play a pivotal role. KS is associated, as are other chromosomal pathologies and genetic diseases, with cardiac congenital anomalies that contribute to the increase in mortality. The aim of the current study was to systematically review the relationships between KS and the cardiovascular system and hemostatic balance. In summary, patients with KS display an increased cardiovascular risk profile, characterized by increased prevalence of metabolic abnormalities including Diabetes mellitus (DM), dyslipidemia, and alterations in biomarkers of cardiovascular disease. KS does not, however, appear to be associated with arterial hypertension. Moreover, KS patients are characterized by subclinical abnormalities in left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function and endothelial function, which, when associated with chronotropic incompetence may led to reduced cardiopulmonary performance. KS patients appear to be at a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, attributing to an increased risk of thromboembolic events with a high prevalence of recurrent venous ulcers, venous insufficiency, recurrent venous and arterial thromboembolism with higher risk of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism.

Ltd.. All rights reserved.Bioleaching has been applied as a successful technique for metal recovery from various mineral sources like low-grade ores, waste materials and tailings. Mixed cultures of bioleaching microorganisms have a high performance in mineral dissolution. Thus far, microbial interactions in bioleaching communities are poorly understood. In this paper, the acidophilic archaeon Ferroplasma acidiphilum and the bacteria Leptospirillum ferriphilum and Sulfobacillus ther-mosulfidooxidans were chosen to study their interactions during pyrite leaching. The initial attachment to pyrite and pyrite leaching efficiency of pure and mixed populations were investigated. The data indicate: (i) attachment and bi-oleaching efficiency of L. ferriphilum was reduced in the presence of F. acidiphilum. However, the combination of F. acidiphilum and S. thermosulfidooxidans showed increased leaching, although the initial attachment rate was reduced, when compared to pure cultures. Thus, synergistic or antagonistic interactions may exist between F. acidiphilum and S. thermosulfidooxidans or F. acidiphilum and L. ferriphilum, respectively; (ii) pre-established biofilms of L. ferriphilum inhibited initial attachment to pyrite by cells of F. acidiphilum and did not promote pyrite leaching by F. acidiphilum. In contrast, inactivated biofilm cells of S. thermosulfidooxidans enhanced pyrite bioleaching by F. acidiphilum; (iii) adhesion forces of cells to an AFM tip (Si3N4) seemed to be not correlated to attachment and bioleaching capacity; and (iv) lectins were applied to show and distinguish single species in mixed biofilm populations.

Background CTO is present in many patients with coronary artery disease and is difficult to treat with percutaneous coronary intervention. Methods The study population consisted of all consecutive patients who underwent coronary angiography in Sweden between January 1, 2005 and January 1, 2012, who were registered in SCAAR (Swedish Coronary Angiography and Angioplasty Registry). The patient population was heterogeneous with regard to indication for angiography (stable angina, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI], unstable angina or non-STEMI, and other) and treatment options. The long-term mortality rates of patients with and without CTO were compared by using shared frailty Cox proportional hazards regression adjusted for confounders. Tests were conducted for interactions between CTO and several pre-specified characteristics: indication for angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (stable angina, STEMI, unstable angina or non-STEMI, and other), severity of coronary artery disease (1-, 2-, and 3-vessel and/or left main coronary artery disease), age, sex, and diabetes. Results During the study period, 14,441 patients with CTO and 75,431 patients without CTO were registered in SCAAR. CTO was associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio: 1.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.22 to 1.37; p < 0.001). In subgroup analyses, the risk attributable to CTO was lowest in patients with stable angina and highest in those with STEMI. In addition, CTO was associated with highest risk in patients under 60 years of age and with lowest risk in octogenarians. There was no interaction between CTO and either diabetes or sex, suggesting an equally adverse effect in both groups. Conclusions In this large prospective observational study of patients with coronary artery disease, CTO was associated with increased mortality. This association was most prominent in younger patients and in those with acute coronary syndromes.","[""Acute Coronary Syndrome"",""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Age Factors"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Angina, Stable"",""Angina, Unstable"",""Angioplasty"",""Chi-Square Distribution"",""Child"",""Child, Preschool"",""Chronic Disease"",""Coronary Angiography"",""Coronary Occlusion"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Infant"",""Infant, Newborn"",""Kaplan-Meier Estimate"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Multivariate Analysis"",""Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction"",""Predictive Value of Tests"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Prospective Studies"",""Registries"",""Risk Factors"",""ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction"",""Sweden"",""Time Factors"",""Treatment Outcome"",""Young Adult""]","[""acute coronary syndrome(s)"",""chronic total occlusion"",""coronary artery disease"",""percutaneous coronary intervention"",""SCAAR""]",10.1016/j.jcin.2016.04.031,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992144610,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcin.2016.04.031,0

However, in forest fires, the carbon stored during photosynthesis is released into the atmosphere. The carbon quantification, in forest burning, is important for the development of measures for its control. The aim of this study was to quantify CO2 and CO emissions of forest fires in Western Amazonia. In this paper, results are described of forest fire experiments conducted in Cruzeiro do Sul and Rio Branco, state of Acre, and Candeias do Jamari, state of Rondônia, Brazil. These cities are located in the Western portion of the Brazilian Amazon region. The biomass content per hectare, in the virgin forest, was measured by indirect methods using formulas with parameters of forest inventories in the central hectare of the test site. The combustion completeness was estimated by randomly selecting 10% of the total logs and twelve 2 × 2 m2 areas along three transects and examining their consumption rates by the fire. The logs were used to determine the combustion completeness of the larger materials (characteristic diameters larger than 10 cm) and the 2 × 2 m2 areas to determine the combustion completeness of small-size materials (those with characteristic diameters lower than 10 cm) and the. The overall biomass consumption by fire was estimated to be 40.0%, 41.2% and 26.2%, in Cruzeiro do Sul, Rio Branco and Candeias do Jamari, respectively. Considering that the combustion gases of carbon in open fires contain approximately 90.0% of CO2 and 10.0% of CO in volumetric basis, the average emission rates of these gases by the burning process, in the three sites, were estimated as 191 ± 46.7 t ha-1 and 13.5 ± 3.3 t ha-1, respectively.","[""Atmospheric emission"",""Average emission rate"",""Biomass consumption"",""CO emissions"",""Consumption rates"",""Controlled experiment"",""Forest fires"",""Forest inventory""]","[""Amazonia forest fires"",""Biomass consumption"",""CO emission"",""CO2 emission""]",10.1016/j.atmosenv.2016.03.043,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962628190,,0

Yet still missing is a widely recognized measuring instrument for diagnostic use at schools. Even large-scale assessments like the OECD PISA-study do not fit the bill. The integration of financial literacy into the framework of traditional German education aims is difficult. There is much debate by experts of economics and financial education didactics about the direction of financial education in German schools. It is becoming apparent that financial literacy focuses too much on personal finance and consumer protection issues. But true ""financial Bildung"" should also incorporate the supply-side perspective and a broader regulatory understanding. The reasons for this mismatch are diverse and indicate the need for further arguments and developments in German schools, politics, research and society.",,"[""Economic literacy in Germany"",""Federalism"",""Financial education"",""Teaching material and teacher training""]",10.1007/978-981-10-0360-8_17,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015788697,,0

Molecular Ecology Published by John Wiley & Sons LtdInferring ecosystem functioning and ecosystem services through inspections of the species inventory is a major aspect of ecological field studies. Ecosystem functions are often stable despite considerable species turnover. Using metatranscriptome analyses, we analyse a thus-far unparalleled freshwater data set which comprises 21 mainland European freshwater lakes from the Sierra Nevada (Spain) to the Carpathian Mountains (Romania) and from northern Germany to the Apennines (Italy) and covers an altitudinal range from 38 m above sea level (a.s.l) to 3110 m a.s.l. The dominant taxa were Chlorophyta and streptophytic algae, Ciliophora, Bacillariophyta and Chrysophyta. Metatranscriptomics provided insights into differences in community composition and into functional diversity via the relative share of taxa to the overall read abundance of distinct functional genes on the ecosystem level. The dominant metabolic pathways in terms of the fraction of expressed sequences in the cDNA libraries were affiliated with primary metabolism, specifically oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis and the TCA cycle. Our analyses indicate that community composition is a good first proxy for the analysis of ecosystem functions. However, differential gene regulation modifies the relative importance of taxa in distinct pathways. Whereas taxon composition varies considerably between lakes, the relative importance of distinct metabolic pathways is much more stable, indicating that ecosystem functioning is buffered against shifts in community composition through a functional redundancy of taxa.","[""Biodiversity"",""Chlorophyta"",""Ciliophora"",""Diatoms"",""Ecosystem"",""Germany"",""Italy"",""Lakes"",""Romania"",""Spain"",""Transcriptome""]","[""community composition"",""functional diversity"",""lake ecosystems"",""microbial ecology"",""protists"",""taxon diversity""]",10.1111/mec.13878,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995694995,https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.13878,0

Previous published works have focused their attention on land subsidence that occurred during the drought period between 1995 and 2008. This work first analyzes the groundwater recovery that has occurred since 2008 and then determines the kind of associated ground deformation detected by the new extensometric data. Subsequently, subsidence time series are computed on 24 geotechnical boreholes scattered throughout the study area by means of a hydro-mechanical finite element code and a linear-elastic constitutive law. A spatio-temporal interpolation of the numerically modeled surface displacements is performed over the whole domain and compared with extensometers and DInSAR-derived displacement maps in two different periods: the drought period from 2004 to 2008, and the recovery period from 2008 to 2012. In spite of the limited information on the geomechanical parameters characterizing the modelled geological formations, the proposed approach is able to discriminate areas where the soils have an elastic behavior (small differences in the comparisons) or an elasto-plastic behavior (large differences in the comparisons).

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of ERA-EDTA. All rights reserved.Background Mortality rates remain high for haemodialysis (HD) patients and simply increasing the HD dose to remove more small solutes does not improve survival. Online haemodiafiltration (HDF) provides additional clearance of larger toxins compared with standard HD. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing HDF with conventional HD on all-cause and cause-specific mortality in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) patients reported inconsistent results and were at high risk of bias. We conducted a pooled individual participant data analysis of RCTs to provide the most reliable evidence to date on the effects of HDF on mortality outcomes in ESKD patients. Methods Individual participant data were used from four trials that compared online HDF with HD and were designed to examine the effects of HDF on mortality endpoints. Bias by informative censoring of patients was resolved. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) comparing the effect of online HDF versus HD on all-cause and cause-specific mortality were calculated using the Cox proportional hazard regression models. The relationship between convection volume and the study outcomes was examined by delivered convection volume standardized to body surface area. Results After a median follow-up of 2.5 years (Q1-Q3: 1.9-3.0), 769 of the 2793 participants had died (292 cardiovascular deaths). Online HDF reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 14% (95% CI: 1%; 25%) and cardiovascular mortality by 23% (95% CI: 3%; 39%). There was no evidence for a differential effect in subgroups. The largest survival benefit was for patients receiving the highest delivered convection volume [>23 L per 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) per session], with a multivariable-adjusted HR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.62; 0.98) for all-cause mortality and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.47; 1.00) for cardiovascular disease mortality. Conclusions This pooled individual participant analysis on the effects of online HDF compared with conventional HD indicates that online HDF reduces the risk of mortality in ESKD patients. This effect holds across a variety of important clinical subgroups of patients and is most pronounced for those receiving a higher convection volume normalized to BSA.","[""Aged"",""Cause of Death"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Hemodiafiltration"",""Humans"",""Kidney Failure, Chronic"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Renal Dialysis"",""Risk Factors"",""Survival Rate""]","[""haemodialysis""]",10.1093/ndt/gfv349,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84975142780,https://academic.oup.com/ndt/article-pdf/31/6/978/17172965/gfv349.pdf,0

However, data in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are limited. We analyzed determinants and prognostic value of AAC in non-dialysis CKD patients. Methods: We included patients with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy from the MASTERPLAN study, a randomized controlled trial that started in 2004. In the period 2008–2009, an X-ray to evaluate AAC was performed in a subgroup of patients. We studied AAC using a semi-quantitative scoring system by lateral lumbar X-ray. We used baseline and 2-year data to find determinants of AAC. We used a composite cardiovascular endpoint and propensity score matching to evaluate the prognostic value of AAC. Results: In 280 patients an X-ray was performed. In 79 patients (28 %) the X-ray showed no calcification, in 62 patients (22 %) calcification was minor (<4), while 139 patients (50 %) had moderate or heavy calcification (≥4). Older age, prior cardiovascular disease, higher triglyceride levels, and higher phosphate levels were independent determinants of a calcification score ≥4. AAC score ≥4 was independently associated with cardiovascular events, with a hazard ratio of 5.5 (95 % confidence interval 1.2–24.8). Conclusions: Assessment of AAC can identify CKD patients at higher cardiovascular risk, and may provide important information for personalized treatment.

Xinjiang is a high tuberculosis and HIV prevalence area in China. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and cure rate of tuberculosis among HIV positive patients in Xinjiang. Methods: In a retrospective study between 2006 and 2011, clinical and laboratory data on 333 patients with HIV and tuberculosis were compared to 2668 patients with HIV only. There were 31 HIV positive patients with no data on tuberculosis. Results: The prevalence of tuberculosis co-infection among the HIV positive patients was 11% (95% CI 10-12%), significantly higher than the national figure in China of 2%. In most cases HIV was diagnosed late, with advanced immunodeficiency. The use of isoniazid preventive therapy was only 57.9% in patients without tuberculosis who fulfilled the criteria for receiving this prevention. The cure rate one year after diagnosis was 69.2%, which was lower than the officially reported 91.4% in all tuberculosis cases in Xinjiang in 2011. The hazard of not surviving over the five years was significantly higher in patients with HIV + tuberculosis compared to HIV only after adjusting for sex and Intravenous drug use with HR = 1.84 (95% CI 1.43-2.35; p < 0.0001). Conclusions: The prevalence of tuberculosis among HIV positive patients in Xinjiang was higher than in China taken as a whole, and HIV was diagnosed late, with underuse of isoniazid preventive therapy. The low cure rate and reduced survival can be due to late diagnosis of HIV and no testing for antibiotic resistance, together with insufficient control of adherence to the treatment regimens for tuberculosis and HIV.","[""Adult"",""Chemoprevention"",""China"",""Coinfection"",""Cross-Sectional Studies"",""Female"",""HIV Infections"",""HIV-1"",""Humans"",""Isoniazid"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Prevalence"",""Remission Induction"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Substance Abuse, Intravenous"",""Treatment Outcome"",""Tuberculosis""]","[""HIV"",""Isoniazid prophylaxis"",""Treatment outcome"",""Tuberculosis""]",10.1186/s12879-016-2152-4,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85008397726,https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12879-016-2152-4,0

Results showed a moderate relation between mental imagery and self-competence beliefs, also after controlling for the quality of students' home literacy environment. Examination of gender differences revealed that girls outperformed boys in self-competence beliefs. Furthermore, boys perceived themselves as better readers when their parents had higher mental imagery skills. No direct relation was found between parents' and adolescents' mental imagery skills.

Journal of Applied Ecology published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of British Ecological Society.Effective management and conservation of terrestrially breeding marine predators requires information on connectivity between specific breeding sites and at-sea foraging areas. In the north-east Atlantic, efforts to monitor and manage the impacts of bycatch or pollution events within different Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) management regions are currently constrained by uncertainty over the origins of seabirds occurring in each area. Whilst Global Positioning System (GPS) loggers can now provide high resolution data on seabird foraging characteristics, their use is largely restricted to the chick-rearing period. Smaller light-based Global Location Sensors (geolocators) could provide valuable data during earlier phases of the breeding season, but additional information on their accuracy is required to assess this potential. We used incubation trip tracking data from 11 double-tagged (GPS/geolocator) northern fulmars Fulmarus glacialis L. within a state-space modelling (SSM) framework to estimate errors around geolocator locations. The SSM was then fitted to a larger sample of geolocator data from the pre-laying exodus using the mean of these error estimates. Geolocator data were first used to compare the trip durations of males and females during this critical pre-laying period. Outputs from the SSM were then used to characterize their spatial distribution and assess the extent of within-colony variation in the use of different OSPAR management regions. During the pre-laying exodus, fulmars from a single colony in the north-east of the United Kingdom foraged widely across several biogeographical regions, up to 2900 km from the colony. Most (60%) males remained within the North Sea region, whereas most (68%) females flew north, foraging within the Norwegian and Barents Sea. A small subset of birds (15%) travelled to the central North Atlantic. Foraging trips by males appeared to be shorter (x = 18 days, n = 20) than by females (x = 25 days, n = 19). Policy implications. Our results of state-space modelling of geolocation data collected from northern fulmars show that within-colony variation in ranging behaviour during the breeding season results in sex differences in exposure to threats such as fisheries bycatch and marine plastics. Birds from a single colony dispersed over several north-east Atlantic management areas. These patterns have implications for interpreting trends in colony-based monitoring schemes, and European Union Marine Strategy Framework programmes using these seabirds as an indicator species for monitoring trends in marine litter and prioritizing efforts to mitigate its impact.",,"[""double-tagging"",""fisheries bycatch"",""geolocator validation"",""GLS"",""Marine Strategy Framework Directive"",""north-east Atlantic"",""northern fulmar"",""OSPAR"",""spatial modelling"",""tracking""]",10.1111/1365-2664.12751,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979645314,https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/1365-2664.12751,0

All rights reserved.Cooking food is a relatively easy process on Earth. Water boils at 100°C, enough to sterilize potential bacterial contaminants, brew tea or coffee, cook rice, potatoes, noodles or boil eggs. However, the boiling point of water is a strong function of atmospheric pressure. At higher altitudes, for example where the atmospheric pressure is lower than at the sea level water boils at temperatures below 100°C. At some extreme terrestrial environments (Himalayas), the boiling point of water falls below the necessary temperature to boil eggs. While rare on the surface of Earth, low atmospheric pressures are common on other planets such as Mars. With an average of 0.6 kPa (6 mbar) at the surface, Mars has an atmospheric pressure less than 1 % of that on Earth. In addition, Mars has only roughly one third of Earth’s gravity. Currently, blueprints are being laid out on how to explore and colonize Mars in the coming decades. While some habitat designs assume 101 kPa (1 bar) internal pressure with terrestrial air composition, others suggest to rely on lower pressures and higher oxygen contents, up to the extreme of 20 kPa (200 mbar) and almost 100% oxygen. However, such low pressures raise the question of how early settlers will prepare their food: Blatantly spoken, will they be able to eat well-boiled eggs for breakfast? What is the minimum pressure for boiling eggs on Mars? And does gravity play an important role in cooking of food on Mars? We will address these questions based on basic thermodynamics and compare the results to state-of-the-art Mars habitat designs. In addition, we will use the experience of altitude cooking at the Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation site for long-term simulated missions to Mars and discuss some practical challenges encountered by the crews there. Finally, we will present a recommendation for habitat pressures from a food preparation standpoint: What is the minimum pressure necessary for cooking on Mars?","[""Bacterial contaminants"",""Food preparation"",""Habitat"",""Low atmospheric pressures"",""Mars"",""Space explorations"",""State of the art"",""Terrestrial environments""]","[""Atmospheric pressure"",""Boiling"",""Cooking"",""Habitat"",""Mars""]",,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85051547246,,0

They can be challenging to identify, which makes monitoring species compositions for fisheries management purposes problematic. Owing to their slow growth and low fecundity, skates are vulnerable to exploitation and species exhibiting endemism or limited ranges are considered to be the most at risk. The Madeira skate Raja maderensis is endemic and classified as ‘Data Deficient’ by the IUCN, yet its taxonomic distinctiveness from the morphologically similar and more wide-ranging thornback ray Raja clavata is unresolved. This study evaluated the sequence divergence of both the variable control region and cytochrome oxidase I ‘DNA barcode’ gene of the mitochondrial genome to elucidate the genetic differentiation of specimens identified as R. maderensis and R. clavata collected across much of their geographic ranges.

The causes of death can be misattributed, particularly in elderly men with multiple comorbidities, and therefore accurate assessment of the underlying cause of death is crucial for valid results. To address potential unreliability of end-point assessment, and its possible impact on mortality results, we analysed the study outcome adjudication data in six countries.Methods:Latent class statistical models were formulated to compare the accuracy of individual adjudicators, and to assess whether accuracy differed between the trial arms. We used the model to assess whether correcting for adjudication inaccuracies might modify the study results.Results:There was some heterogeneity in adjudication accuracy of causes of death, but no consistent differential accuracy by trial arm. Correcting the estimated screening effect for misclassification did not alter the estimated mortality effect of screening.Conclusions:Our findings were consistent with earlier reports on the European screening trial. Observer variation, while demonstrably present, is unlikely to have materially biased the main study results. A bias in assigning causes of death that might have explained the mortality reduction by screening can be effectively ruled out.","[""Aged"",""Belgium"",""Cause of Death"",""Death Certificates"",""Early Detection of Cancer"",""Europe"",""Finland"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Male"",""Mass Screening"",""Middle Aged"",""Netherlands"",""Prostatic Neoplasms"",""Registries"",""Research Design"",""Statistics as Topic"",""Sweden"",""Switzerland""]",,10.1038/bjc.2016.378,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84995752307,https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2016378.pdf,0

Our ranking defines small towns exclusively in terms of their commercial and service functions, not according to size (population or jobs). Accordingly small towns are characterized by their function both in terms of education (presence of a high school), healthcare (a hospital with an operating theatre) and trade (a supermarket with floorspace exceeding 2,500 square metres). The population of small French towns identified using these criteria ranges from 6,200 to 35,500, with 3,500 to 19,000 jobs, depending on their regional context. Large hub-bourgs, defined as places hosting a secondary school, supermarket and nursing home, emerge as the lower limit of the urban world, interfacing with the countryside. In several ways they might count as 'very small towns', with a population ranging from 2,400 to 13,500, and 1,000 to 4,700 jobs. The article then analyses the population dynamic of small towns in mainland France over the past 50 years.

It may exhibit the potential for patients under dabigatran therapy suffering ischemic stroke to regain eligibility for thrombolysis with rt-PA and may inhibit lesion growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage on dabigatran. Aims: To provide insights into the clinical use of idarucizumab in patients under effective dabigatran anticoagulation presenting with signs of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage. Methods: Retrospective data collected from German neurological/neurosurgical departments administering idarucizumab following product launch from January to August 2016 were used. Results: Thirty-one patients presenting with signs of stroke received idarucizumab in 22 stroke centers. Nineteen patients treated with dabigatran presented with ischemic stroke and 12 patients suffered from intracranial bleeding. In patients receiving rt-PA thrombolysis following idarucizumab, 79% benefitted from i.v. thrombolysis with a median improvement of five points in NIHSS. No bleeding complications occurred. Hematoma growth was observed in 2 out of 12 patients with intracranial hemorrhage. The outcome was favorable with a median NIHSS improvement of 5.5 points and mRS 0–3 in 67%. Overall, mortality was low with 6.5% (one patient in each group). Conclusion: Administration of rt-PA after reversing dabigatran activity with idarucizumab in case of ischemic stroke is feasible, easy to manage, effective, and appears to be safe. In dabigatran-associated intracranial hemorrhage, idarucizumab has the potential to prevent hematoma growth and improve outcome. Idarucizumab represents a new therapeutic option for patients under dabigatran treatment presenting with ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.","[""Aged"",""Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized"",""Antithrombins"",""Brain Ischemia"",""Dabigatran"",""Female"",""Germany"",""Humans"",""Intracranial Hemorrhages"",""Male"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Stroke"",""Thrombolytic Therapy"",""Tissue Plasminogen Activator""]","[""dabigatran"",""Idarucizumab"",""intracranial hemorrhage"",""ischemic stroke"",""outcome"",""thrombolysis""]",10.1177/1747493017701944,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019221822,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1747493017701944,0

In this study, an input/output-based hybrid life-cycle assessment (LCA) method is developed to assess the consumption-based carbon footprint of the average tourist including direct and indirect emissions. The total inbound tourism-related GHG emissions are also calculated within a certain region. As a demonstration of the method, the full carbon footprint of an average tourist is assessed as well as the total GHG emissions induced by tourism to Iceland over the period of 2010-2015, with the presented approach applicable in other contexts as well. Iceland provides an interesting case due to three features: (1) the tourism sector in Iceland is the fastest-growing industry in the country with an annual growth rate of over 20% over the past five years; (2) almost all tourists arrive by air; and (3) the country has an almost emissions-free energy industry and an import-dominated economy, which emphasise the role of the indirect emissions. According to the assessment, the carbon footprint for the average tourist is 1.35 tons of CO2-eq, but ranges from 1.1 to 3.2 tons of CO2-eq depending on the distance travelled by air. Furthermore, this footprint is increasing due to the rise in average flight distances travelled to reach the country. The total GHG emissions caused by tourism in Iceland have tripled from approximately 600,000 tons of CO2-eq in 2010 to 1,800,000 tons in 2015. Aviation accounts for 50%-82% of this impact (depending on the flight distance) underlining the importance of air travel, especially as tourism-related aviation is forecasted to grow significantly in the near future. From a method perspective, the carbon footprinting application presented in the study would seem to provide an efficient way to study both the direct and indirect emissions and to provide new insights and information to enable the development of appropriate GHG mitigation policies in the tourism sector..",,"[""Aviation"",""Carbon footprint"",""Greenhouse gas"",""Input-output"",""Life-cycle assessment"",""Tourism"",""Transport""]",10.3390/su8111147,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85000981901,https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/11/1147/pdf,0

This paper introduces a new multi-objective optimization model for the synthesis of work and heat exchange networks (WHENs), aiming to obtain the optimal balance between economic and environmental performance. The proposed multistage superstructure allows power and thermal integration of process gaseous streams, through the simultaneous minimization of total annualized cost (TAC) and environmental impacts (EI). The latter objective is determined by environmental indicators that follow the life cycle assessment (LCA) principles. The WHEN superstructure is optimized as a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (moMINLP) model and solved with the GAMS software. Results show a decrease of ∼79% in the heat transfer area and ∼32% in the capital cost between the solutions found for single problem optimizations. These results represent a diminution of ∼23.5% in the TAC, while EI is increased in ∼99.2%. As these solutions can be impractical for economic or environmental reasons, we present a set of alternative Pareto-optimal solutions to support decision-makers towards the implementation of more environment-friendly and cost-effective WHENs.","[""Cost analysis"",""Economic and environmental performance"",""Heat integration"",""Heat-exchange networks"",""Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)"",""Mixed-integer nonlinear programming"",""Multi-objective optimization models"",""Multi-objective synthesis""]","[""Cost analysis"",""Life cycle assessment (LCA)"",""Multi-objective optimization (MOO)"",""Work and heat exchange network (WHEN)"",""Work and heat integration""]",10.1016/j.enconman.2017.02.074,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85014636325,http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/66511/5/2017_Onishi_etal_EnergyCon%26Man_accepted.pdf,0

Restoration is being proposed to assist recovery but little is known regarding methods suitable under Scandinavian conditions; e.g. short growing seasons and scouring by ice. In the present study we evaluated different restoration methods using shoots and seeds in a Swedish fjord and assessed if eelgrass could be successfully transplanted between sites with different depth and exposure. The study demonstrates that both shoot- and seed methods can be successfully used to restore eelgrass at this latitude. Survival and growth of unanchored single shoots, transplanted without sediment in shallow habitats (1.0-1.5 m) was very high (>. 500% increase in shoot density after 14 months). This restoration method showed 2-3.5 times higher growth rate and was 2-2.5 times faster compared with shoots anchored in the sediment and shoots transplanted in sediment cores, respectively, and is recommended for shallow habitats in Sweden. Growth within deeper habitats (3.0-4.5 m) was substantially lower (40% loss to 50% increase) due to light limitations and high winter mortality. Restoration using seeds distributed from mesh-bags showed very low seedling establishment rates (approximately 1%) making this method less cost-effective than transplanting single shoots in shallow habitats. However, growth of seedlings was high and this method is recommended for deep habitats with soft sediment where shoot transplantation is difficult. Despite dramatic differences in eelgrass morphology between habitats with different depth and exposure, all shoots within a planting site had the same morphology at the end of the study, independent of origin. A baseline genetic survey supported that the observed changes in morphology of transplants were due to a plastic response, suggesting that donor populations do not have to exactly match the morphology of the plants targeted for restoration.",,"[""Cross-transplantation"",""Eelgrass"",""High latitude"",""Method assessment"",""Restoration"",""Seeds""]",10.1016/j.jembe.2016.03.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961840021,,0

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background: Several studies have found that standard risk scores inaccurately reflect risk in TAVI cohorts. The assessment of mortality risk upon post-interventional ICU admission is important to optimizing clinical management. This study sought to determine outcomes and factors affecting mortality in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), and to analyze and compare the predictive values of SAPS II and EuroSCORE. Methods and Findings: 214 consecutive patients treated with transfemoral TAVI (2006-2012) admitted to the ICU in an academic tertiary-care university hospital, were included in this retrospective data analysis. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 7%. Non-survivors at 30-days and survivors showed differences in the rates of catecholamine therapy upon ICU admission (93 vs. 29%; p<0.001), stroke (20 vs. 1%;p<0.001), sepsis (27 vs. 2%;p<0.001), kidney injury (83 vs. 56%; log-rank p<0.001), catecholamine therapy (88 vs. 61%;log-rank p<0.001) and vascular complications (60 vs. 17%; p<0.001). Mean SAPS II score and predicted mortality were higher in non-survivors (38.1±7.0 vs. 29.9±6.2;p<0.001 and 23.1±11.7 vs. 10.5±8.2; p<0.001, retrospectively), whereas the logistic EuroSCORE could not discriminate between the groups (p = 0.555). Among the biochemical parameters, the maximum values of creatinine, procalcitonin, and troponin I during the first 48 h after ICU admission were significantly higher in non-survivors. Multivariate analysis of baseline characteristics and complications associated with two-year mortality showed no significant results. Conclusions: The SAPS II is a good tool for estimating ICU mortality immediately after performing the TAVI procedure and provides valuable information for other known predictors of mortality.","[""Acute Kidney Injury"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Aortic Valve"",""Aortic Valve Stenosis"",""Calcitonin"",""Creatinine"",""Critical Care"",""Disease-Free Survival"",""Female"",""Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation"",""Humans"",""Intensive Care Units"",""Male"",""Postoperative Complications"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Assessment"",""Sepsis"",""Stroke"",""Survival Rate"",""Troponin I""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0167072,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84996553459,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0167072,0

This effect has often been attributed to perioperative α‑receptor blockade. However, this has never been tested in a randomized trial and many other changes have contributed to this improvement. At the same time α‑receptor blockade was introduced, short-acting and well controllable agents became available for intraoperative arterial blood pressure management. Subsequently, surgical techniques improved and led almost exclusively to minimally invasive techniques, while improvements in the diagnostic techniques allow earlier and more precise detection of catecholamine-producing tumors. Methods: Conduction of a randomized, controlled study to investigate the effect of α‑receptor blockade on mortality is hampered by the rarity of the disease. With the currently low mortality rate, several thousands of patients would be needed to test such a hypothesis. Accordingly, intraoperative management is generally based on expert opinion. Hypertensive episodes are treated by intravenous administration of sodium nitroprusside, urapidil or nitroglycerine. Depending on the individual case a short-acting β‑blocker and magnesium might be added. Hypotension following tumor removal is treated with intravenous fluid infusion and continuous norepinephrine administration. Adrenal gland-sparing resection of pheochromocytoma does not seem to increase the risk of arterial hypertension. Conclusion: Future research should focus on identification of risk factors for intraoperative hypertensive episodes and the question whether a time-consuming, unreliable α‑receptor blockade, burdened with significant side effects, is still needed.","[""Adrenal Gland Neoplasms"",""Adrenalectomy"",""Anesthetics"",""Antihypertensive Agents"",""Evidence-Based Medicine"",""Humans"",""Hypertension"",""Monitoring, Intraoperative"",""Pheochromocytoma"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""Alpha-receptor blockade"",""Blood pressure control"",""Hypotension"",""Paraganglioma"",""Sodium nitroprusside""]",10.1007/s00120-016-0082-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966552333,,0

Translation of these technologies into clinical practice is limited by a paucity of evidence for cost-effectiveness. Methodological issues, including lack of agreement on assessment methods, limit the value of meta-analyses of trials. In this paper we report the consensus reached on assessment protocols and outcome measures for evaluation of the upper extremity in neurorehabilitation using technology. The outcomes of this research will be part of the development of European guidelines. Methods: A rigorous, systematic and comprehensive modified Delphi study incorporated questions and statements generation, design and piloting of consensus questionnaire and five consensus experts groups consisting of clinicians, clinical researchers, non-clinical researchers, and engineers, all with working experience of neurological assessments or technologies. For data analysis, two major groups were created: i) clinicians (e.g., practicing therapists and medical doctors) and ii) researchers (clinical and non-clinical researchers (e.g. movement scientists, technology developers and engineers). Results: Fifteen questions or statements were identified during an initial ideas generation round, following which the questionnaire was designed and piloted. Subsequently, questions and statements went through five consensus rounds over 20 months in four European countries. Two hundred eight participants: 60 clinicians (29 %), 35 clinical researchers (17 %), 77 non-clinical researchers (37 %) and 35 engineers (17 %) contributed.

All rights reserved.There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.","[""Animals"",""Biodiversity"",""Ecosystem"",""Food Chain"",""Invertebrates"",""Vertebrates""]","[""Biodiversity"",""Ecological networks"",""Ecosystem functioning"",""Trait matching""]",10.1098/rstb.2015.0268,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964470880,https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/pdf/10.1098/rstb.2015.0268,0

This study was established to determine the feasibility and impact of decentralizing comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (CEmONC) services in underserved rural areas using associate clinicians. Methods Ten health centres (HCs) were upgraded by constructing and equipping maternity blocks, operating rooms, laboratories, staff houses and installing solar panels, standby generators and water supply systems. Twenty-three assistant medical officers (advanced level associate clinicians), and forty-four nurse-midwives and clinical officers (associate clinicians) were trained in CEmONC and anaesthesia respectively. CEmONC services were launched between 2009 and 2012. Monthly supportive supervision and clinical audits of adverse pregnancy outcomes were introduced in 2011 in these HCs and their respective district hospitals. Findings After launching CEmONC services from 2009 to 2014 institutional deliveries increased in all upgraded rural HCs. Mean numbers of monthly deliveries increased by 151% and obstetric referrals decreased from 9% to 3% (p = 0.03) in HCs. A total of 43,846 deliveries and 2,890 caesarean sections (CS) were performed in these HCs making the mean proportion of all births in EmONC facilities of 128% and mean population-based CS rate of 9%. There were 190 maternal deaths and 1,198 intrapartum and very early neonatal deaths (IVEND) in all health facilities. Generally, health centres had statistically significantly lower maternal mortality ratios and IVEND rates than district hospitals (p < 0.00 and < 0.02 respectively). Of all deaths (maternal and IVEND) 84% to 96% were considered avoidable. Conclusions These findings strongly indicate that remotely located health centres in resource limited settings hold a great potential to increase accessibility to CEmONC services and to improve maternal and perinatal health.","[""Cesarean Section"",""Data Collection"",""Delivery, Obstetric"",""Female"",""Health Personnel"",""Health Services Accessibility"",""Humans"",""Infant, Newborn"",""Maternal Health Services"",""Maternal Mortality"",""Nurse Midwives"",""Perinatal Care"",""Perinatal Mortality"",""Pregnancy"",""Pregnancy Outcome"",""Referral and Consultation"",""Rural Health Services"",""Tanzania""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0151419,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982266496,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0151419&type=printable,0

We analyzed differences in the access to EVT by geographical areas in Catalonia, a territory with a highly decentralized stroke model. Methods - We studied 965 patients treated with EVT from a prospective multicenter population-based registry of stroke patients treated with reperfusion therapies in Catalonia, Spain (SONIIA). Three different areas were defined: (A) health areas primarily covered by Comprehensive Stroke Centers, (B) areas primarily covered by local stroke centers located less than hour away from a Comprehensive Stroke Center, and (C) areas primarily covered by local stroke centers located more than hour away from a Comprehensive Stroke Center. We compared the number of EVT×100 000 inhabitants/year and time from stroke onset to groin puncture between groups. Results - Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Throughout the study period, there were significant differences in the population rates of EVT across geographical areas. EVT rates by 100 000 in 2015 were 10.5 in A area, 3.7 in B, and 2.7 in C. Time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 82 minutes longer in group B (312 minutes [245-435]) and 120 minutes longer in group C (350 minutes [284-408]) compared with group A (230 minutes [160-407]; P<0.001).

We focused on the roles of different restoration parameters (i.e., the number, spatial extent and type of restoration measure applied and restoration age) and specific environmental characteristics in regulating changes in plant diversity and trait composition following restoration. Among restoration characteristics, restoration type was the only significant determinant of plant community responses, with stream channel widening having the strongest effects, particularly on the diversity and composition of species traits favoured by increases in physical disturbance (e.g. flooding) and open habitat patch availability (e.g. plant growth form, life strategy and life span). Of the environmental variables, altitude and discharge were positively and most strongly related to responses of both species and trait diversity.

In this study, we investigated the distribution of shore crabs Carcinus maenas infected with the rhizocephalan parasite Sacculina carcini at 12 locations and in 3 adjacent habitats (intertidal mussel beds, intertidal bare sand flats and subtidal gullies) along a tidal elevation gradient in the Dutch Wadden Sea. Our sampling revealed that of the 27 629 crabs investigated, most infected crabs were found in the subtidal gullies and almost none on intertidal bare sand flats or mussel beds at all of the 12 locations. This probably resulted from a parasite-induced manipulation of infected crabs to behave like egg-bearing females which migrate towards deeper waters, as the same pattern was observed in the distribution of non-infected ovigerous females. The prevalence of both infected crabs and ovigerous females in the gullies was significantly correlated with water depth, and both tended to increase (albeit not significantly) with increasing salinity.

Blooms have been associated with noxious effects on human health and mortality of marine organisms, due to the production of palytoxin-like compounds. We analyzed the toxin concentrations throughout an O. cf. ovata bloom to highlight their relationships with environmental parameters in the Conero Riviera, northern Adriatic Sea. High temperature and balanced nutrient conditions were the optimal environmental conditions to start and sustain blooms as well as to maximize toxin production. Ostreopsis showed a gradual decrease of toxin content throughout the bloom ascribed to the occurring of the same non-optimal conditions that led to the bloom decline. Moreover, our results suggest that toxin fraction released during bloom could be higher than that released in batch culture. Results from this study pointed out that the first bloom phase is potentially the most dangerous to human health.","[""Environmental conditions"",""Environmental factors"",""Environmental parameter"",""Harmful algae"",""Mediterranean coasts"",""Northern Adriatic Sea"",""Ovatoxins"",""Palytoxin"",""Dinoflagellida"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Harmful Algal Bloom"",""Marine Toxins"",""Oceans and Seas"",""Temperature"",""Water Pollutants""]","[""Harmful algae"",""Nutrients"",""Ovatoxins"",""Palytoxin"",""Temperature"",""Toxicity""]",10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.08.049,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85028471889,,0

Patients, however, commonly feel their complaint is ignored. This situation may be because clinicians perceive fatigue to be benign, unrelated to traditional biomedical outcomes such as premature mortality. The present study aimed to investigate whether an association between significant fatigue and mortality actually exists, and, if so, to identify potential mechanisms of this association. Methods: A population-based cohort of 18,101 men and women aged 40-79 years who completed a measure of fatigue (Short Form 36 vitality domain, SF36-VT) in addition to providing information on possible confounding factors (age, sex, body mass index, marital status, smoking, education level, alcohol consumption, social class, depression, bodily pain, diabetes, use of β blockers, physical activity and diet) and mechanisms (haemoglobin, C-reactive protein and thyroid function) were followed up prospectively for up to 20 years. Mortality from all causes, cancer and cardiovascular disease was ascertained using death certification linkage with the UK Office of National Statistics. Results: During 300,322 person years of follow-up (mean 16.6 years), 4397 deaths occurred. After adjusting for confounders, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.40 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.56) for those reporting the highest fatigue (bottom SF36-VT quartile) compared with those reporting the lowest fatigue (top SF36-VT quartile). This significant association was specifically observed for those deaths related to cardiovascular disease (HR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.18-1.78) but not cancer (HR 1.09, 95 % CI 0.90-1.32). Of the considered mechanisms, thyroid function was most notable for attenuating this association. The risk of all-cause mortality, however, remained significant even after considering all putative confounders and mechanisms (HR 1.26, 95 % CI 1.10-1.45). Conclusions: High levels of fatigue are associated with excess mortality in the general population. This commonly dismissed symptom demands greater evaluation and should not automatically be considered benign.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Fatigue"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Prospective Studies"",""Risk""]","[""Cancer"",""Cardiovascular"",""Fatigue"",""Mortality""]",10.1186/s12916-016-0662-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982273244,https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12916-016-0662-y,0

Alterations in species distribution or drought-induced tree mortality might not only result in a loss of biodiversity but also in a loss of other ecosystem services. Here, we evaluate spatial trends and patterns of the growth-climate relationship in a tree-ring network comprising 33 juniper sites from the northern Pamir-Alay and Tien Shan mountain ranges in eastern Uzbekistan and across Kyrgyzstan for the common period 1935-2011. Junipers growing at lower elevations are sensitive to summer drought, which has increased in intensity during the studied period. At higher elevations, juniper growth, previously favored by warm summer temperatures, has in the recent few decades,become negatively affected by increasing summer aridity. Moreover, response shifts are observed during all seasons. Rising temperatures and alterations in precipitation patterns during the past eight decades can account for the observed increase in drought stress of junipers at all altitudes. The implications of our findings are vital for the application of adequate long- Term measures of ecosystem conservation, but also for paleo-climatic approaches and coupled climate-vegetation model simulations for Central Asia.","[""Asia"",""Biodiversity"",""Climate Change"",""Droughts"",""Ecosystem"",""Juniperus"",""Stress, Physiological"",""Trees""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0153888,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964855809,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0153888,0

Unfortunately, the cost of a cubic meter of fresh water produced by an RO plants is still high and many efforts are in progress to increase the efficiency of the membranes used in osmotic plants and to limit the energy required by the process. A further reduction of the energy cost could be obtained by an optimal operation of the desalination plant so reducing the hourly energy cost, or by coupling the RO plant with an energy production plant based on direct osmosis (Pressure Retarded Osmosis PRO). The economic viability of the desalination process has been analyzed until now without accounting for the integration of the RO plant with the existing water network. This analysis is developed in the present paper with reference to a hypothetical change of water supply in a real network, where a desalination plant is used to satisfy the fresh water demand. Several scenarios will be analyzed to assess the minimum cost of fresh water production and water supply to the network, including the use of energy recovery systems, such as an integrated use of RO and PRO processes, or the regulation of pressure at the network intake by a micro hydro power plant.","[""Desalination plant"",""Economic viability"",""Energy production plants"",""Energy recovery system"",""Fresh water production"",""Microhydro power plants"",""Pressure-retarded osmosis"",""Water supply networks""]","[""Desalination"",""Osmosis"",""PAT"",""Water supply network""]",10.1007/s11269-016-1404-9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84974802727,,0

Here, we examine the effects of forest patch and landscape metrics, and levels of forest disturbance on the patterns of persistence of six gamebird taxa in the southern Brazilian Amazon. We use both interview data conducted with long-term residents and/or landowners from 129 remnant forest patches and 15 continuous forest sites and line-transect census data from a subset of 21 forest patches and two continuous forests. Forest patch area was the strongest predictor of species persistence, explaining as much as 46% of the overall variation in gamebird species richness. Logistic regression models showed that anthropogenic disturbance- including surface wildfires, selective logging and hunting pressure-had a variety of effects on species persistence. Most large-bodied gamebird species were sensitive to forest fragmentation, occupying primarily large, high-quality forest patches in higher abundances, and were typically absent from patches <100 ha.

The activated sludge model consists of anammox and heterotrophic bacteria using a novel stoichiometric matrix. Identifiability of sensitive biokinetic parameters of the model was assessed with regards to observed concentrations of ammonium-, nitrite-, and nitrate-nitrogen. The Chi-squared function was used for the error estimation and the R-squared index (R2) was used for the regression analysis. The results imply that the model can elucidate the interactions of nitrogen converting bacteria in a biofilm system for various feeding characteristics. The calibration results showed satisfactory R2 equal to 0.95, 0.97 and 0.67 for NH4-N, NO2-N and NO3-N respectively. For validation, model simulations were performed under three varying scenarios and R2 was more than 0.9 so that all forecasted values lied within the 95% confidence interval. In addition, the estimated physiologic characterization of two dominant anammox species was discussed upon calibration and validation of the model. The maximum specific bacterial growth rates (μmax) for Candidatus Brocadia anammoxidans and Ca. Scalindua sp. were estimated at 0.0025 h−1 and 0.0048 h−1 respectively. Decay rate of Ca.

Long-term air monitoring of POPs is conducted under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) at four Arctic stations: Alert, Canada; Stórhöfði, Iceland; Zeppelin, Svalbard; and Pallas, Finland, since the 1990s using high volume air samplers. Temporal trends observed for POPs in Arctic air are summarized in this study. Most POPs listed for control under the SC, e.g. polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and chlordanes, are declining slowly in Arctic air, reflecting the reduction of primary emissions during the last two decades and increasing importance of secondary emissions. Slow declining trends also signifies their persistence and slow degradation under the Arctic environment, such that they are still detectable after being banned for decades in many countries. Some POPs, e.g. hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and lighter PCBs, showed increasing trends at specific locations, which may be attributable to warming in the region and continued primary emissions at source. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) do not decline in air at Canada's Alert station but are declining in European Arctic air, which may be due to influence of local sources at Alert and the much higher historical usage of PBDEs in North America. Arctic air samples are screened for chemicals of emerging concern to provide information regarding their environmental persistence (P) and long-range transport potential (LRTP), which are important criteria for classification as a POP under SC. The AMAP network provides consistent and comparable air monitoring data of POPs for trend development and acts as a bridge between national monitoring programs and SC's Global Monitoring Plan (GMP).","[""Arctic"",""Long-range transport potentials"",""Long-term air monitoring of POPs"",""Persistent organic pollutant (POP)"",""Polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDEs)"",""Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs)"",""Seasonality"",""Temporal trends"",""Air Pollutants"",""Arctic Regions"",""Atmosphere"",""Canada"",""Chlordan"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Finland"",""Halogenated Diphenyl Ethers"",""Hexachlorobenzene"",""Iceland"",""International Cooperation"",""Polychlorinated Biphenyls"",""Program Evaluation"",""Svalbard"",""Time Factors""]","[""Air"",""Arctic"",""Persistent organic pollutants"",""Seasonality"",""Temporal trends""]",10.1016/j.envpol.2016.01.079,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971451856,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envpol.2016.01.079,0

Despite increasing research efforts to understand how caulerpin modifies fish physiology, little is known on the effects of algal metabolites on mammalian cells. Here we report for the first time the mitochondrial targeting activity of both caulerpin, and its closely related derivative caulerpinic acid, by using as experimental model rat liver mitochondria, a system in which bioenergetics mechanisms are not altered. Mitochondrial function was tested by polarographic and spectrophotometric methods. Both compounds were found to selectively inhibit respiratory complex II activity, while complexes I, III, and IV remained functional. These results led us to hypothesize that both algal metabolites could be used as antitumor agents in cell lines with defects in mitochondrial complex I. Ovarian cancer cisplatin-resistant cells are a good example of cell lines with a defective complex I function on which these molecules seem to have a toxic effect on proliferation. This provided novel insight toward the potential use of metabolites from invasive Caulerpa species for the treatment of human ovarian carcinoma cisplatin-resistant cells.","[""Cell Respiration"",""Chlorophyta"",""Electron Transport Complex II"",""Feasibility Studies"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Indoles"",""Mitochondria, Liver"",""Mitochondrial Proteins"",""Ovarian Neoplasms""]","[""Algal metabolites"",""Caulerpa"",""Marine biological invasions"",""Mitochondria"",""Ovarian cancer cells"",""Respiration""]",10.1016/j.bbrc.2016.04.028,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963838664,,0

Thus, they provide valuable information not only about the chemical conditions of their and their hosts' environment but also deliver insights into the biological availability of allochthonous substances. While a large number of different freshwater parasites (mainly acanthocephalans and cestodes) were investigated in terms of pollutant bioaccumulation, studies based on marine host-parasites systems remain scarce. However, available data show that different marine parasite taxa such as nematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans exhibit also an excellent metal accumulation capacity. The biological availability of metals and their uptake routes in marine biota and parasites differ from those of freshwater organisms. We assume that a large part of metals and other pollutants are also taken up via the digestive system of the host. Therefore, in addition to environmental conditions the physiology of the host also plays an important role for the accumulation process. Additionally, we highlight some advantages in using parasites as accumulation indicators in marine ecosystems. As parasites occur ubiquitously in marine food webs, the monitoring of metals in their tissues can deliver information about the spatial and trophic distribution of pollutants. Accordingly, parasites as indicators offer an ecological assessment on a broader scale, in contrast to established free-living marine indicators, which are mostly benthic invertebrates and therefore limited in habitat distribution. Globally distributed parasite taxa, which are highly abundant in a large number of host species, are suggested as worldwide applicable sentinels.",,"[""Accumulation"",""Marine ecosystems"",""Metals"",""Parasites"",""Pollution"",""Sentinels""]",10.1016/j.seares.2015.06.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84933573964,,0

A more mature entrepreneurial ecosystem was built gradually by these actors through their progressive creation of innovation intermediaries and coordination among the local players involved in the creation of start-ups. We analyse how the university became a hub organisation. We use the case of the University of Strasbourg to show that the university contributed to the development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem by acting as a boundary spanner and by building and orchestrating the network of the stakeholders in the local system of innovation. This ‘hub’ university became a leading regional organisation at the political level. The TTO played a central role in supporting academic entrepreneurship at the operational level based on its evolution from a revenue maximising model to a model that takes account of social and economic regional development.

This study assesses the phenomenon by exploring how consumers response to self-benefit versus environmental benefits in the advertisements of green products. Results showed that chocolate, advertised with a self-benefit appeal was received as less costly, of higher quality and the purchase intentions was higher, compared to the environmental appeal.

Differently from existing online auto-tuners, which regenerate code with long compilation chains from the source to the binary code, our approach consists on deploying auto-tuning directly at the level of machine code generation. This allows auto-tuning to pay off in very short-running applications. As a proof of concept, our approach is demonstrated in two benchmarks, which execute during hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds only. In a CPU-bound kernel, the average speedups achieved are 1.10 to 1.58 depending on the target micro-architecture, up to 2.53 in the most favourable conditions (all run-time overheads included). In a memory-bound kernel, less favourable to our runtime auto-tuning optimizations, the average speedups are 1.04 to 1.10, up to 1.30 in the best configuration. Despite the short execution times of our benchmarks, the overhead of our runtime auto-tuning is between 0.2 and 4.2 % only of the total application execution times. By simulating the CPU-bound application in 11 different CPUs, we showed that, despite the clear hardware disadvantage of In-Order (IO) cores vs. Out-of-Order (OOO) equivalent cores, online auto-tuning in IO CPUs obtained an average speedup of 1.03 and an energy efficiency improvement of 39 % over the SIMD reference in OOO CPUs.","[""Application execution"",""data specialization"",""Energy efficiency improvements"",""Heterogeneous cores"",""Micro architectures"",""On-line auto-tuning"",""Program specialization"",""Running applications""]","[""data specialization"",""heterogeneous cores"",""Micro-architecture"",""program specialization""]",10.1109/MCSoC.2016.11,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010441774,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04566,0

African Development Review © 2016 African Development BankThis paper explores the use of continuous-time Markov chain theory to describe poverty dynamics. It is shown how poverty measures can be derived beyond the commonly reported headcounts and transition probabilities. The added measures include the stationary situation, the mean sojourn time in a given poverty state and an index for mobility. Probit regression is employed to identify the most influential factors on the transition probabilities. Moreover, sensitivity analysis shows that the results are robust against perturbations of the transition matrix. We illustrate the approach with pseudo-panel data constructed from a repeated cross-section survey in Mozambique, using a pairwise matching method to connect households in the 2003 sample to similar households in 2009. Results reflect high and persistent poverty levels with considerable movements into and out of poverty. An estimated 57 percent of the poor in the first wave remained poor in the second wave and 43 percent moved out. Likewise, 64 percent remained non-poor and 36 percent moved in.

We aimed to investigate the relationship between OA and mortality from any cause and from cardiovascular disease (CVD). Methods Electronic literature databases searches were conducted to identify prospective studies comparing mortality in a sample of people with and without OA. Risk of all-cause and CVD mortality were summarized using adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for joint specific (hand, hip, and knee) and joint non-specific OA. New data from the Progetto Veneto Anziani (PRO.V.A.) study were also included. Results From the PRO.V.A. study (N = 2927), there was no significant increase in mortality risk for participants with any joint OA (N = 1858) compared to non-OA (all-cause, HR = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.77–1.15 and CVD, HR = 1.12, 95% CI: 0.82–1.54). On meta-analysis, seven studies (OA = 10,018/non-OA = 18,541), with a median 12-year follow-up, reported no increased risk of any-cause mortality in those with OA (HR = 1.10, 95% CI: 0.97–1.25). After removing data on hand OA, a significant association between OA and mortality was observed (HR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08–1.28). There was a significant higher risk of overall mortality for (1) studies conducted in Europe, (2) patients with multi-joint OA; and (3) a radiological diagnosis of OA. OA was associated with significantly higher CVD mortality (HR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.10–1.34). Conclusions People with OA are at increased risk of death due to CVD. The relationship with overall mortality is less clear and may be moderated by the presence of hand OA.","[""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Comorbidity"",""Humans"",""Osteoarthritis"",""Prospective Studies"",""Risk Factors""]","[""Cardiovascular disease"",""Mortality"",""Osteoarthritis""]",10.1016/j.semarthrit.2016.04.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84970021650,http://gala.gre.ac.uk/id/eprint/15834/1/15834_Thompson_Osteoarthritis%20and%20mortality%20%28AAM%29%202016.pdf,0

All rights reserved.Seagrasses are the only higher plants living in fully marine environments; they play a significant role in coastal ecosystems. Seagrasses inhabit the coastal shelves of all continents except Antarctica and can grow in depths of up to 90 m. Because of their eminent ecological importance, innumerous studies have been dedicated to seagrasses and their ecology. However, the phytochemistry has not been equally well investigated yet and many of the existing studies in chemical ecology are only investigating the chemistry at the level of compound classes, e.g. phenolics, and not at the level of chemically defined metabolites. In the present review, the existing literature on secondary metabolites of seagrasses, their known source seagrasses, their bioactivity, and ecological function are compiled and critically assessed. Moreover, research gaps are highlighted and avenues for future research are discussed. Currently, a total of 154 chemically defined natural products have been reported from the about 70 seagrass species known worldwide. Compounds reported include simple phenols derivatives (four compounds), phenylmethane derivatives (14 compounds), phenylethane derivatives (four compounds), phenylpropane derivatives including their esters and dimers (20 compounds), chalkones (four compounds), flavonoids including catechins (57 compounds), phenylheptanoids (four compounds), one monoterpene derivative, one sesquiterpene, diterpenoids (13 compounds), steroids (31 compounds), and one alkaloid. Most of the existing bioactivity studies of seagrass metabolites and extracts have been directed to potential cytotoxic, antimicrobial, or antimacrofouling activity. Antimicrobial studies have been performed towards panels of both human pathogens and ecologically relevant pathogens. In the antimacrofouling studies, investigations of the potential of zosteric acid from the genus Zostera are the most numerous and have yielded so far the most interesting results. Studies on the chemical ecology of seagrasses often have been focused on variation in phenolic compounds and include but are not limited to studies on variation due to abiotic factors, seasonal variation, variation in response to grazing by fish or sea urchins, or following microbial attack.","[""Alismatidae"",""Animals"",""Ecology"",""Ecosystem"",""Humans"",""Marine Biology"",""Seasons""]","[""Chemosystematics"",""Cymodoceaceae"",""Hydrocharitaceae"",""Marine higher plants"",""Posidoniaceae"",""Zosteraceae""]",10.1016/j.phytochem.2016.02.004,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960364951,,0

Moreover, AuNP may result in some negative effects in the environment and there is a necessity to predict their aquatic environmental concentrations by parameterizing the underlying transport and transformation processes. This study investigated the coagulation and sedimentation of 30 nm citrate-coated AuNP under enviro-mimicking conditions, i.e. model natural freshwaters (MNW) covering the range of European water chemistries relevant for colloids and NP (major ions, pH and dissolved organic matter) and artificial seawater (ASW). Firstly, the coagulation rates of AuNP at mg/L concentrations were evaluated using time-resolved dynamic light scattering which showed a decreased rate upon addition of Suwannee river natural organic matter (SRNOM) at low ionic strength (IS) but remained relatively high at high IS. Contrastingly, AuNP approaching environmental realistic concentrations (80 μg/L) in quiescent microcosms showed slow decline rates in all MNW and ASW regardless of the presence of SRNOM, as measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis and elemental Au spectrometry. When illite was added as model natural colloid the rates of decline of AuNP remained low as well. This is owing to limited collisions at low particle number concentrations. The results show that besides IS, pH, NOM concentration and type and the intrinsic surface charge of the particles, the particle number concentration and size distribution of both AuNP and natural colloids determine the extent of the large-scale fate of NP in aquatic environments.",,"[""Fate and transport nanoparticles"",""Model nanoparticles"",""Natural colloids"",""Natural water chemistry""]",10.1016/j.impact.2016.10.004,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85027946999,,0

However, whether recreational use by the public is enhanced at protected areas designated for nature conservation is unknown. This is the first study to model outdoor recreation at a national scale, examining habitat preferences with statutory designation (Site of Special Scientific Interest) as an indicator of nature conservation importance. Models were based on a massive, three year national household survey providing spatially-referenced recreational visits to the natural environment. Site characteristics including land cover were compared between these observed visit sites (n = 31,502) and randomly chosen control sites (n = 63,000). Recreationists preferred areas of coast, freshwater, broadleaved woodland and higher densities of footpaths and avoided arable, coniferous woodland and lowland heath. Although conservation designation offers similar or greater public access than undesignated areas of the same habitat, statutory designation decreased the probability of visitation to coastal and freshwater sites and gave no effect for broadleaved woodland. Thus general recreational use by the public did not represent an important ecosystem service of protected high-nature-value areas, so that intrinsic and existence values remain as the primary justifications for conservation of high nature value areas. Management of 'green infrastructure' sites of lower conservation value that offer desirable habitats and enhanced provision of footpaths, could mitigate recreational impacts on nearby valuable conservation areas.","[""Agriculture"",""Algorithms"",""Conservation of Natural Resources"",""Data Collection"",""Ecosystem"",""England"",""Europe"",""Forests"",""Fresh Water"",""Geography"",""Humans"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Recreation""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0165043,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84994709535,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0165043&type=printable,0

Design/methodology/approach: The experience of a place may become an integral part of a product experience. The enhancement of products (Splendiani, 2013): assumes a meaning which goes beyond the simple sale of material goods. It covers the supply of complex experiences … enriched by intangible elements capable to stimulate and involve the sensory and experiential component of consumption. It deals with attracting people to the places where local products are made by inserting the products in the most extensive offers covering the entire territorial system of reference The experience may also be used for the spectacolarisation of a place and its commercialisation, as in the case of “brandscapes” (Klingman, 2007). In this case, it is important not to clone every place everywhere because they could inevitably resemble each other without be able to really engage the people who move into them (Lehtovuori, 2010). The methodology approach is based on a wide bibliography and internet research based on the main terms connected to the topics of the paper, including experience, place identity, quality product, regeneration; on case studies – even though not illustrated – concerning places of interest for the research topics, such as: Hafencity in Hamburg, the Albert Dock in Liverpool, Abondaibarra area in Bilbao. Findings: The planning of places of quality product cannot be separated from interpretation of the territory as a cultural system resulting from an ensemble of historical, economic and social processes. In such a system, the contribution of the cultural factor must be considered propulsive, not only for its qualitative meaning but also, and especially, for the role of “trait d’union” of a number of actions taken to protect and enhance places. Originality/value: The increasing importance of the use of experience in the urban regeneration process is leading cities to be involved in constructing suitable images and symbols of their transformed areas to meet the new trends, also according with luxurious ones. Even though globalisation is one of the main dangers in innovative itineraries, the proper planning of quality architecture and public spaces could prevent it by creating a suitable mix between innovation and culture.",,"[""Place"",""Quality products"",""Urban branding"",""Urban design"",""Urban experience"",""Urban regeneration""]",10.1108/JFM-10-2016-0042,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019693885,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1522130/1/JFM.pdf,0

The TP experiments were carried out at 80, 100, 120°C for 2 h and 140°C for 1 h. The designed TP set-up was able to minimize the organic matter loss during the course of the pretreatment. Soluble organic fractions evaluated in terms of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and soluble protein increased linearly with pretreatment temperature. In contrast, the carbohydrate solubilization was more enhanced (30% higher solubilization) by the TP at lower temperature (80°C). A slight increment of soluble phenols was found, particularly for temperatures exceeding 100°C. Thermally pretreated FW under all conditions exhibited an improved methane yield compared to the untreated FW, due to the increased organic matter solubilization. The highest cumulative methane yield of 442 (±8.6) mL/gVS added , corresponding to a 28.1% enhancement compared to the untreated FW, was obtained with a TP at 80°C.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly between natural and social sciences, is perceived as crucial to solving the significant challenges facing humanity. However, despite the need for such collaboration being expressed more frequently and intensely, it remains unclear to what degree such collaboration actually takes place, what trends and developments there are and which actors are involved. Previous studies, often based on bibliometric analysis of large bodies of literature, partly observed an increase in interdisciplinary collaboration in general, but in particular, the collaboration among distant fields was less explored. Other more qualitative studies found that interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly between natural and social scientists was not well developed, and obstacles abounded. To shed some light on the actual status and developments of this collaboration, we performed an analysis based on a sample of articles on groundwater research. We first identified journals and articles therein that potentially combined natural and social science aspects of groundwater research. Next, we analysed the disciplinary composition of their authors' teams, cited references, titles and keywords, making use of our detailed personal expertise in groundwater research and its interdisciplinary aspects. We combined several indicators developed from this analysis into a final classification of the degree of multidisciplinarity of each article. Covering the period between 1990 and 2014, we found that the overall percentage of multidisciplinary articles was in the low single-digit range, with only slight increases over the past decades. The interdisciplinarity of individuals plays a major role compared to interdisciplinarity involving two or more researchers. If collaboration with natural sciences takes place, social science is represented most often by economists. As a side result, we found that journals publishing multidisciplinary research had lower impact factors on average, and multidisciplinary papers were cited much less than mono-disciplinary ones.","[""Bibliometrics"",""Cooperative Behavior"",""Groundwater"",""Humans"",""Interdisciplinary Studies"",""Natural Science Disciplines"",""Publishing"",""Research"",""Research Personnel"",""Social Sciences""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0170754,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010904858,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170754&type=printable,0

A steady improvement in the level of major risk factors has been evident since 1980. This trend explains 72% of the decrease in premature mortality from coronary artery disease during the past three decades. However, an opposing trend in increasing obesity and type 2 diabetes has attenuated this decline in premature deaths. Unchanged risk factor trends will lead to increasing cardiovascular mortality in the years to come. This will result from the above mentioned changes in major risk factors as well as an increased ageing of the Icelandic population. At the same time case fatality after myocardial infarction has declined substantially. This will result in a steadily growing proportion of elderly in the population as well as a high burden of chronic non-communicable diseases among the elderly population. The resulting increase in long term disease and disability will put a major constraint on the health care system and economy alike.

This work examines the use of a culture of Gluconobacter japonicus CECT 8443, without pH control, to convert selectively the glucose content of industrially pasteurized strawberry purée into gluconic acid for the development of new beverages. However, depending on the initial concentration of glucose, the microorganism could transform the acid formed into other compounds; for this reason, in this work the effect of initial sugar concentration on the preservation of the acid was investigated. The results show that the gluconic acid formed in strawberry purée containing no added sugars started to disappear after glucose depletion, but the acid concentration remained constant if sugar-enriched purée was used. The use of this industrial substrate resulted in the presence of yeasts and hence in some fructose uptake; however, the fructose consumption was negligible until after 20-30 h. The use of food by-products is an excellent opportunity not only to recover valuable compounds but for the development of new chemical and biotechnological approaches for their revalorization. This strategy should improve regional economies and contribute to a sustainable management of these underexploited resources.","[""Biotechnological approaches"",""Gluconic acids"",""Gluconobacter"",""Initial concentration"",""Revalorization"",""Strawberry surpluses"",""Sugar concentration"",""Sustainable management""]","[""Batch processing"",""Gluconic acid"",""Gluconobacter japonicus CECT 8443"",""Revalorization"",""Strawberry purée"",""Strawberry surpluses""]",10.1016/j.fbp.2016.05.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971338591,,0

Despite substantial progress in reducing maternal mortality in the last two decades, the rate of adolescent pregnancy remains high. The use of skilled maternal health services is still low in Bangladesh. Several quantitative studies described the use of skilled maternal health services among adolescent girls. So far, very little qualitative evidence exists about attitudes and practices related to maternal health. To fill this gap, we aimed at exploring maternal health care-seeking behavior of adolescent girls and their experiences related to pregnancy and delivery in Bangladesh. Methods and Findings A prospective qualitative study was conducted among thirty married adolescent girls from three Upazilas (sub-districts) of Rangpur district. They were interviewed in two subsequent phases (2014 and 2015). To triangulate and validate the data collected from these married adolescent girls, key informant interviews (KIIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with different stakeholders. Data analysis was guided by the Social-Ecological Model (SEM) including four levels of factors (individual, interpersonal and family, community and social, and organizational and health systems level) which influenced the maternal health care-seeking behavior of adolescent girls. While adolescent girls showed little decision making-autonomy, interpersonal and family level factors played an important role in their use of skilled maternal health services. In addition, community and social factors and as well as organizational and health systems factors shaped adolescent girls' maternal health care-seeking behavior. Conclusions In order to improve the maternal health of adolescent girls, all four levels of factors of SEM should be taken into account while developing health interventions targeting adolescent girls.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Bangladesh"",""Female"",""Focus Groups"",""Humans"",""Marriage"",""Maternal Health"",""Maternal Health Services"",""Patient Acceptance of Health Care"",""Pregnancy"",""Pregnancy in Adolescence"",""Prospective Studies"",""Qualitative Research"",""Rural Population"",""Social Environment"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0169109,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009813148,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169109,0

Design Population-based prospective cohort study. Participants A total of 4966 individuals aged 67 to 96 years (43.2% were male) from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES-RS). Methods Retinopathy was evaluated from digital fundus images (2002-2006) using the modified Airlie House adaptation of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study protocol. Mortality was assessed through September 2013 (cause of death assigned through 2009). Cox proportional hazards regression models, with age as the time scale, estimated the association between retinopathy and death while controlling for risk factors and the presence of concomitant health conditions. Main Outcome Measures Mortality from all causes and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Results Among the 4966 participants, 503 (10.1%) had diabetes and 614 (12.4%) had retinopathy at baseline. A subset of these (136 [2.7%]) had both diabetes and retinopathy. After a median follow-up of 8.6 years, 1763 persons died, 276 (45.0%) with retinopathy and 1487 (34.2%) without retinopathy, of whom 76 and 162 persons, respectively, also had diabetes. There were 366 deaths from CVD through 2009, 72 (11.7%) in persons with retinopathy and 294 (6.8%) in those without retinopathy. In multivariable analyses, retinopathy was significantly associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-1.43; P < 0.01) and CVD-related mortality (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.20-2.06; P < 0.01). Findings were more striking in men: all-cause HR, 1.33 (95% CI, 1.11-1.60) and CVD HR, 1.81 (95% CI, 1.25-2.63). Risk of mortality was further increased among those with retinopathy concomitant with microalbuminuria (all-cause HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.03-2.23, and CVD HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.27-3.28) and those with retinopathy, microalbuminuria, and diabetes (all-cause HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.22-3.31, and CVD HR, 5.24; 95% CI, 1.91-14.42). History of clinical stroke increased the risk of CVD-related mortality among persons with retinopathy (HR, 3.30; 95% CI, 2.05-5.32), particularly those with retinopathy and diabetes (HR, 5.38; 95% CI, 1.80-16.06). Conclusions Even minimal retinopathy was a significant predictor of increased mortality in older persons, particularly men, irrespective of diabetes status. Persons with retinopathy may warrant closer clinical management of general health.","[""Age Factors"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Cardiovascular Diseases"",""Comorbidity"",""Diabetes Mellitus"",""Female"",""Gene-Environment Interaction"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Prospective Studies"",""Retinal Diseases"",""Risk Factors"",""Sex Factors""]",,10.1016/j.ophtha.2016.02.045,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962772507,http://www.aaojournal.org/article/S0161642016003328/pdf,0

These techniques use live plants and entrust most of their structural resistance to wood members whose mechanical characteristics, however, decrease with time. Very few investigations have dealt with the decay of mechanical characteristics of wood elements employed in soil bioengineering techniques and lifetime predictions. This information is also important for durability forecasting. In this paper we present the results of experimental analyses carried out to evaluate the degradation of mechanical properties of untreated timber elements, which were collected from single and double live cribwalls or check-dams built about 10 years ago in the Vesuvius National Park (Naples, Southern Italy). To help in adequately interpreting the behavior of a complex material such as wood, a novelty of this study is not only the coupling of the ultrasonic and sclerometric nondestructive testing (NDT) methods so as to reduce measurement errors, but also to frame the outcomes from mechanical tests within the biological analysis of fungi detected on the timbers. Exploratory statistical analyses have revealed that there exist nearly no correlations between moisture contents in the timber elements and both transversal and longitudinal ultrasonic velocities, but some clustering provides insights in the results obtained. Comparisons between results using data measured on ""old"" and ""new"" timber elements enable some evaluations of residual safety factor assessment to be carried out.","[""Degradation assessment"",""Degradation of mechanical properties"",""Erosion control"",""Longitudinal ultrasonic"",""Mechanical characteristics"",""Residual life"",""Soil bioengineerings"",""Traditional structures""]","[""Degradation"",""Erosion control"",""Mechanical properties"",""Nondestructive testing"",""Residual life"",""Slope protection"",""Soil bioengineering"",""Wood""]",10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.01.085,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960081714,,0

Graphene powder with different degrees of oxidation was synthesised and subsequently used to prepare supported membranes. Ceramic porous materials were chosen as membrane support due to the robustness and long life required in a likely application. Ultrathin membranes (7–9 µm) were successfully prepared through vacuum filtration of highly oxidised graphene or reduced graphene oxide solutions (1 mg ml−1). The influence of depositing different amounts of membrane precursor was extensively studied (0.003–0.037 mg cm−2); above 0.037 mg cm−2, drying-related shrinkage problems are detected. Moreover, the ceramic support pore size (SPS) (0.008–0.08 µm) shows little impact in terms of the overall membrane flux resistance, and the deposited graphene layer usually governs the membrane permeation. Finally, long-term filtration experiments were also performed for weeks without substantial variation of the membrane structure or permeation (≤2 %), which is demanded in most conventional water treatments. Overall, the addition of partially oxidised graphene to conventional ceramic membranes greatly decreases their electrical resistivity (~2.8 × 10−5 Ω m), opening up the possibility of being employed for many environmental purposes.","[""Conventional water treatment"",""Filtration experiments"",""Membrane permeation"",""Photocatalytic process"",""Reduced graphene oxides"",""Substantial variations"",""Ultra-thin membranes"",""Water and wastewater treatments""]",,10.1007/s10853-016-0075-5,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84974803113,,0

All rights reserved.Aims: Very few women become interventional cardiologists, although a substantial proportion of cardiologists and the majority of medical students are women. In accordance with the EAPCI Women Committee mission of attaining gender equality at the professional level, a worldwide survey was recently conducted aiming to understand better the motivations and the barriers for women in selecting interventional cardiology (IC) as a career path. Methods and results: A total of 1,787 individuals (60.7% women) responded to the survey. Women compared to men were less frequently married (women vs. men, 57.0% vs. 79.8%, p<0.001) and more frequently childless (46.6% vs. 20.5%, p<0.002). The most prevalent reason for choosing IC was passion (83.3% vs. 76.1%, p=0.12), while those for not choosing were, sequentially, lack of opportunity (29.0% vs. 45.7%), radiation concerns (19.9% vs. 11.6%) and preference (16.2% vs. 29.5%), p<0.001. According to 652 men replying to why, in their opinion, women do not choose IC, on-calls and long working hours were the most frequent reasons (35.3%). Conclusions: Several barriers preclude women from choosing IC, including lack of opportunity, concerns regarding radiation exposure and the prejudices of their male colleagues. This highlights the need to develop new strategies for future training, education, and support of women in order to choose IC.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Cardiology"",""Career Choice"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Motivation"",""Sex Factors"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Young Adult""]","[""Gender"",""Interventional cardiology"",""Survey"",""Women""]",10.4244/EIJY15M07_03,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84969523081,,0

In particular, perinatal remains are one of the best indicators of breeding practices at archaeological sites. Nevertheless, remains from this age group, and especially fetal remains, have been largely ignored in archaeozoological studies. In the Neolithic (6th–4th millennium cal.

Due to this relative abundance at El Mirador, we studied the remains of animals from this age group, distinguishing fetal remains from neonatal remains by means of anatomical and metric criteria. We found that in El Mirador cave fetal and neonatal remains were present on most levels. The fetal remains exhibit mortality ratios similar to current-day sheep flocks.

Patients, however, commonly feel their complaint is ignored. This situation may be because clinicians perceive fatigue to be benign, unrelated to traditional biomedical outcomes such as premature mortality. The present study aimed to investigate whether an association between significant fatigue and mortality actually exists, and, if so, to identify potential mechanisms of this association. Methods: A population-based cohort of 18,101 men and women aged 40-79 years who completed a measure of fatigue (Short Form 36 vitality domain, SF36-VT) in addition to providing information on possible confounding factors (age, sex, body mass index, marital status, smoking, education level, alcohol consumption, social class, depression, bodily pain, diabetes, use of β blockers, physical activity and diet) and mechanisms (haemoglobin, C-reactive protein and thyroid function) were followed up prospectively for up to 20 years. Mortality from all causes, cancer and cardiovascular disease was ascertained using death certification linkage with the UK Office of National Statistics. Results: During 300,322 person years of follow-up (mean 16.6 years), 4397 deaths occurred. After adjusting for confounders, the hazard ratio (HR) for all-cause mortality was 1.40 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.56) for those reporting the highest fatigue (bottom SF36-VT quartile) compared with those reporting the lowest fatigue (top SF36-VT quartile). This significant association was specifically observed for those deaths related to cardiovascular disease (HR 1.45, 95 % CI 1.18-1.78) but not cancer (HR 1.09, 95 % CI 0.90-1.32). Of the considered mechanisms, thyroid function was most notable for attenuating this association. The risk of all-cause mortality, however, remained significant even after considering all putative confounders and mechanisms (HR 1.26, 95 % CI 1.10-1.45). Conclusions: High levels of fatigue are associated with excess mortality in the general population. This commonly dismissed symptom demands greater evaluation and should not automatically be considered benign.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Fatigue"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Prospective Studies"",""Risk""]","[""Cancer"",""Cardiovascular"",""Fatigue"",""Mortality""]",10.1186/s12916-016-0662-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982273244,https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12916-016-0662-y,0

Myocardial G protein-coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2) is upregulated in HF patients, causing dysfunctional β-adrenergic receptor signaling. Importantly, myocardial GRK2 levels correlate with levels found in peripheral lymphocytes of HF patients. Objective: The independent prognostic value of blood GRK2 measurements in HF patients has never been investigated; thus, the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether lymphocyte GRK2 levels predict clinical outcome in HF patients. Methods and Results: We prospectively studied 257 HF patients with mean left ventricular ejection fraction of 31.4±8.5%. At the time of enrollment, plasma norepinephrine, serum NT-proBNP, and lymphocyte GRK2 levels, as well as clinical and instrumental variables were measured. The prognostic value of GRK2 to predict cardiovascular (CV) death and all-cause mortality was assessed using the Cox proportional hazard model including demographic, clinical, instrumental, and laboratory data. Over a mean follow-up period of 37.5±20.2 months (range, 3-60 months), there were 102 CV deaths. Age, left ventricular ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide, and lymphocyte GRK2 protein levels were independent predictors of CV mortality in HF patients. GRK2 levels showed an additional prognostic and clinical value over demographic and clinical variables. The independent prognostic value of lymphocyte GRK2 levels was also confirmed for all-cause mortality.

In this study, biofilm carriers from a fully nitrifying MBBR system, fed with mainstream wastewater, were temporarily exposed to reject water from sludge dewatering, to evaluate this as a possible strategy to inhibit NOB and achieve nitrite production under realistic conditions. Two different carrier types were compared, in which biofilm thickness was maintained at approximately 400 and 50 μm, respectively, and reject treatment was tested at different exposure time and loading rates. Reject exposure almost always resulted in an increased nitrite production in the thinner biofilm, and overall, nitrifiers growing in the thin biofilm were more sensitive than those grown in the thicker biofilm. The effect from reject exposure remained in the systems for four days after returning to mainstream operation, with nitrite production gradually increasing for three days. Increased concentrations of free ammonia correlated with reject exposure and may be the cause of inhibition, although other factors cannot be excluded.","[""ANAMMOX"",""Bio-film thickness"",""Inhibitory effect"",""MBBR"",""Nitrifying population"",""Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria"",""Realistic conditions"",""Sludge dewatering"",""Bacteria"",""Biofilms"",""Bioreactors"",""Nitrification"",""Nitrites"",""Water""]","[""Biofilm thickness"",""FISH-CLSM"",""MBBR"",""Nitritation-anammox"",""NOB inhibition"",""Optical coherence tomography""]",10.1016/j.watres.2016.08.027,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983082113,,0

Participants are instructed to follow a certain decision rule according to safety guidelines. Violations of this rule are associated with potential high rewards (working faster and earning more money) but also with the risk of a catastrophe (an explosion). Stress was induced with the Trier Social Stress Test while control participants underwent a non-stress condition. In the simulation task, stressed females broke the safety rule more often than unstressed females: χ2 (1, N = 24) = 10.36, p < 0.001, V = 0.66. In males, no difference between stressed and unstressed participants was observed. We conclude that stress increased the decisions to break the safety rule because stressed female participants focused on the potential high gains while they neglected the risk of potential negative consequences.","[""Adult"",""Decision Making"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Psychological Tests"",""Reward"",""Risk-Taking"",""Safety"",""Sex Factors"",""Stress, Psychological""]","[""Cortisol"",""Decision making"",""Stress"",""Trier Social Stress Test"",""Waste Water Treatment Simulation""]",10.1016/j.biopsycho.2016.04.067,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84966727914,,0

These global trends occur on top of natural variability. In environments such as estuarine areas, short-term acute pH and O2 fluctuations are occurring simultaneously. The present study tested the combined effects of short-term seawater acidification and hypoxia on the physiology and energy budget of the thick shell mussel Mytilus coruscus. Mussels were exposed for 72 h to six combined treatments with three pH levels (8.1, 7.7 and 7.3) and two dissolved oxygen (DO) levels (2 mg L-1, 6 mg L-1). Clearance rate (CR), food absorption efficiency (AE), respiration rate (RR), ammonium excretion rate (ER), O:N ratio and scope for growth (SFG) were significantly reduced, and faecal organic dry weight ratio (E) was significantly increased at low DO. Low pH did not lead to a reduced SFG. Interactive effects of pH and DO were observed for CR, E and RR. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed positive relationships among most physiological indicators, especially between SFG and CR under normal DO conditions. These results demonstrate that Mytilus coruscus was sensitive to short-term (72 h) exposure to decreased O2 especially if combined with decreased pH levels. In conclusion, the short-term oxygen and pH variation significantly induced physiological changes of mussels with some interactive effects.","[""Absorption efficiency"",""Anthropogenic activity"",""Energy budgets"",""Hypoxia"",""Mussel"",""Ocean acidifications"",""Physiological indicators"",""Seawater acidifications"",""Animals"",""Carbon Dioxide"",""Energy Metabolism"",""Homeostasis"",""Hydrogen-Ion Concentration"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Mytilus"",""Oxygen"",""Seawater""]","[""Acidification"",""CO2"",""Energy budget"",""Hypoxia"",""Mussel"",""Physiology""]",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.04.054,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84963967656,,0

However, data in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are limited. We analyzed determinants and prognostic value of AAC in non-dialysis CKD patients. Methods: We included patients with CKD not receiving renal replacement therapy from the MASTERPLAN study, a randomized controlled trial that started in 2004. In the period 2008–2009, an X-ray to evaluate AAC was performed in a subgroup of patients. We studied AAC using a semi-quantitative scoring system by lateral lumbar X-ray. We used baseline and 2-year data to find determinants of AAC. We used a composite cardiovascular endpoint and propensity score matching to evaluate the prognostic value of AAC. Results: In 280 patients an X-ray was performed. In 79 patients (28 %) the X-ray showed no calcification, in 62 patients (22 %) calcification was minor (<4), while 139 patients (50 %) had moderate or heavy calcification (≥4). Older age, prior cardiovascular disease, higher triglyceride levels, and higher phosphate levels were independent determinants of a calcification score ≥4. AAC score ≥4 was independently associated with cardiovascular events, with a hazard ratio of 5.5 (95 % confidence interval 1.2–24.8).

Findings of a complex evaluation,"© 2016 Ganaba et al.Background: Burkina Faso, like many low and middle income countries, has been taking a range of actions to address its poor maternal and neonatal health indicators. In 2006 the government introduced an innovative national subsidy scheme for deliveries and emergency obstetric care in public facilities. This article reports on a complex evaluation of this policy, carried out 5 years after its introduction, which examined its effects on utilisation, quality of care, equity and the health system as a whole, as well as its cost and sustainability. Methods: The evaluation was carried out in six purposively selected districts, as well as at national level, using a case study approach. Data sources included: national and district routine and survey data, household interviews with women who had recently given birth, data extraction from hospital and medical records, and key informant and health worker interviews. Results: The underlying secular trend of a 1 % annual increase in the facility-based delivery rate (1988-2010) was augmented by an additional 4 % annual increase from 2007 onwards (after the policy was introduced), especially in rural areas and amongst women from poor households. The absence of baseline quality of care data made it difficult to assess the impact of the policy on quality of care, but hospitals with the best level of implementation of the subsidy offered higher quality of care (as measured by health care near-misses), so there is no evidence of a negative impact on quality (as is often feared). Similarly, there is little evidence of unintended negative effects on untargeted services. Household payments for facility-based deliveries have reduced significantly, compared with payments before the policy, and the policy as a whole is affordable, costing about 2 % of total public health expenditure.Concerns include that the amounts paid by households are higher than the rates set by the policy, and also that 7 % of households still say that they cannot afford to pay. Wealthier women have higher utilisation of services, as before, and the policy of fully exempting indigents is not being put into practice. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of maintaining the subsidy policy, given the evidence of positive outcomes, but they also point out areas where attention is needed to ensure the poor and most vulnerable population benefit fully from the policy.","[""Burkina Faso"",""Delivery, Obstetric"",""Female"",""Financing, Government"",""Health Policy"",""Health Services Accessibility"",""Humans"",""Maternal Health Services"",""Patient Acceptance of Health Care"",""Pregnancy"",""Program Evaluation""]","[""Burkina Fas"",""Cost of obstetric care"",""Evaluation"",""Health system"",""Maternal health"",""Policy"",""Quality of care"",""Removal of user fees""]",10.1186/s12884-016-0875-2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84977557055,https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12884-016-0875-2,0

Here we report the genome of Zostera marina (L.), the first, to our knowledge, marine angiosperm to be fully sequenced. This reveals unique insights into the genomic losses and gains involved in achieving the structural and physiological adaptations required for its marine lifestyle, arguably the most severe habitat shift ever accomplished by flowering plants. Key angiosperm innovations that were lost include the entire repertoire of stomatal genes, genes involved in the synthesis of terpenoids and ethylene signalling, and genes for ultraviolet protection and phytochromes for far-red sensing. Seagrasses have also regained functions enabling them to adjust to full salinity. Their cell walls contain all of the polysaccharides typical of land plants, but also contain polyanionic, low-methylated pectins and sulfated galactans, a feature shared with the cell walls of all macroalgae and that is important for ion homoeostasis, nutrient uptake and O 2/CO 2 exchange through leaf epidermal cells. The Z. marina genome resource will markedly advance a wide range of functional ecological studies from adaptation of marine ecosystems under climate warming, to unravelling the mechanisms of osmoregulation under high salinities that may further inform our understanding of the evolution of salt tolerance in crop plants.","[""Acclimatization"",""Adaptation, Physiological"",""Cell Wall"",""Ethylenes"",""Evolution, Molecular"",""Gene Duplication"",""Genes, Plant"",""Genome, Plant"",""Metabolic Networks and Pathways"",""Molecular Sequence Data"",""Oceans and Seas"",""Osmoregulation"",""Phylogeny"",""Plant Leaves"",""Plant Stomata"",""Pollen"",""Salinity"",""Salt-Tolerance"",""Seawater"",""Seaweed"",""Terpenes"",""Zosteraceae""]",,10.1038/nature16548,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84949269317,https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16548.pdf,0

This paper reports on four nascent ‘new economic’ narratives which represent fundamentally different imaginaries of the urban economy. Experiments informed by these narratives challenge the dominant neoliberal logic in four key dimensions: What is the purpose of economic development? What are the preferred distributive mechanisms? Who governs the economy? What is the preferred form of economic organisation? The emergence of these experiments illustrates that cities are spaces where counter-narratives can emerge and circulate.

Identifying barriers and enablers using the Theoretical Domains Framework,"© 2016 Roberts et al.Background: Major Trauma Centers (MTCs), as part of a trauma system, improve survival and functional outcomes from injury. Developing such centers from current teaching hospitals is likely to generate diverse beliefs amongst staff. These may act as barriers or enablers. Prior identification of these may make the service development process more efficient. The importance of applying theory to systematically identify barriers and enablers to changing clinical practice in emergency medicine has been emphasized. This study systematically explored theory-based barriers and enablers towards implementing the transformation of a tertiary hospital into a MTC. Our goal was to demonstrate the use of a replicable method to identify targets that could be addressed to achieve a successful transformation from an organization evolved to provide a particular type of clinical care into a clinical system with different demands, requirements and expectations. Methods: The Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) is a tool designed to elicit and analyze beliefs affecting behavior. Semi-structured interviews based around the TDF were conducted in a major tertiary hospital in Scotland due to become a MTC with a purposive sample of major stakeholders including clinicians and nurses from specialties involved in trauma care, clinical managers and administration. Belief statements were identified through qualitative analysis, and assessed for importance according to prevalence, discordance and evidence base. Results and discussion: 1728 utterances were recorded and coded into 91 belief statements. 58 were classified as important barriers/enablers. There were major concerns about resource demands, with optimism conditional on these being met. Distracting priorities abound within the Emergency Department. Better communication is needed. Staff motivation is high and they should be engaged in skills development and developing performance improvement processes. Conclusions: This study presents a systematic and replicable method of identifying theory-based barriers and enablers towards complex service development. It identifies multiple barriers/enablers that may serve as a basis for developing an implementation intervention to enhance the development of MTCs. This method can be used to address similar challenges in developing specialist centers or implementing clinical practice change in emergency care across both developing and developed countries.","[""Administrative Personnel"",""Cooperative Behavior"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Interviews as Topic"",""Male"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Organizational Innovation"",""Qualitative Research"",""Scotland"",""Tertiary Care Centers"",""Trauma Centers""]",,10.1186/s13049-016-0226-3,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960416275,https://sjtrem.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13049-016-0226-3,0

Particulate matter (PM2.5) metrics applied to second hand smoke (SHS) concentrations provide indoor air quality (IAQ) measurements and have been used to promote smoking behaviour change among parents of young children. Here, we present the qualitative results from a study designed to use IAQ measurements to help pregnant women who smoke to quit smoking. Methods: We used IAQ measurements in two centres (Aberdeen and Coventry) using two interventions: 1. In Aberdeen, women made IAQ measurements in their homes following routine ultrasound scan; 2. In Coventry, IAQ measurements were added to a home-based Stop Smoking in Pregnancy Service. All women were invited to give a qualitative interview to explore acceptability and feasibility of IAQ measurements to help with smoking cessation. A case study approach using grounded theory was applied to develop a typology of pregnant women who smoke. Results: There were 39 women recruited (18 in Aberdeen and 21 in Coventry) and qualitative interviews were undertaken with nine of those women. Diverse accounts of smoking behaviours and experiences of participation were given. Many women reported changes to their smoking behaviours during pregnancy. Most women wanted to make further changes to their own behaviour, but could not commit or felt constrained by living with a partner or family members who smoked. Others could not envisage quitting. Using themes emerging from the interviews, we constructed a typology where women were classified as follows: 'champions for change'; 'keen, but not committed'; and 'can't quit, won't quit'. Three women reported quitting smoking alongside participation in our study. Conclusions: Pregnant women who smoke remain hard to engage,. Although providing IAQ measurements does not obviously improve quit rates, it can support changes in smoking behaviour in/around the home for some individuals. Our typology might offer a useful assessment tool for midwives.","[""Adult"",""Air Pollution, Indoor"",""Female"",""Grounded Theory"",""Humans"",""Motivation"",""Pregnancy"",""Pregnancy Complications"",""Pregnant Women"",""Qualitative Research"",""Smoking"",""Smoking Cessation"",""Tobacco Smoke Pollution"",""United Kingdom""]","[""Behaviour change"",""Child health"",""Indoor air quality (IAQ)"",""Pregnancy"",""Qualitative health research"",""Second hand smoke (SHS)"",""Smoking cessation services""]",10.1186/s12884-016-1062-1,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84990940956,https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12884-016-1062-1,0

All rights reserved.Ocean acidification affects marine ecosystems and carbon cycling, and is considered a direct effect of anthropogenic carbon dioxide uptake from the atmosphere. Accumulation of atmospheric CO2 in ocean surface waters is predicted to make the ocean twice as acidic by the end of this century. The Arctic Ocean is particularly sensitive to ocean acidification because more CO2 can dissolve in cold water. Here we present observations of the chemical and physical characteristics of East Siberian Arctic Shelf waters from 1999, 2000-2005, 2008 and 2011, and find extreme aragonite undersaturation that reflects acidity levels in excess of those projected in this region for 2100. Dissolved inorganic carbon isotopic data and Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations of water sources using salinity and Î 18 O data suggest that the persistent acidification is driven by the degradation of terrestrial organic matter and discharge of Arctic river water with elevated CO2 concentrations, rather than by uptake of atmospheric CO2. We suggest that East Siberian Arctic Shelf waters may become more acidic if thawing permafrost leads to enhanced terrestrial organic carbon inputs and if freshwater additions continue to increase, which may affect their efficiency as a source of CO2.",,,10.1038/ngeo2695,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84971272978,,0

In countries with large peatland areas, the GHG mitigation potential related to management of these soils is often estimated as the highest amongst the measures available in agriculture. Although the facts are well known, the policies leading to diminished emissions are often difficult to implement. We have analysed the reasons why the mitigation potential is not fully utilized and what could be done better in national implementation of climate policies. Four cases are used to illustrate the necessary steps to reach mitigation targets: determining the amount and properties of peat soils, estimating the potential, costs and feasibility of the mitigation measures, and selecting and implementing the best measures. A common feature for all of the cases was that national and international climate policies have increased the public interest in GHG emissions from peat soils and increased the pressure for mitigation. Basically the same factors restrict the implementation of mitigation measures in all countries with significant peat soil areas. The most important of these is lack of policy coherence, e.g. ignoring climate policies when planning land use or agricultural policies. We conclude that GHG mitigation is achieved only if other policies, especially national regulations and strategies, are in line with climate policies. Policy relevance Agricultural peat soils could be used to help reach GHG mitigation goals in many countries, but the full potential of mitigation of peat soils is not used. Although peatland cultivation inevitably leads to loss of the whole peat layer and high emissions, there are few incentives or regulation to effectively minimize these losses. This article discusses the possibilities to reduce GHG emissions from agricultural peat soils, with specific emphasis on the barriers of implementing mitigation measures nationally. The lessons learned from the selected cases emphasize the role of all policy makers and their cooperation in planning coherent policies for achieving the goals determined by climate policies.",,"[""agriculture"",""GHG"",""land use"",""mitigation"",""peat"",""policies""]",10.1080/14693062.2015.1022854,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925397258,https://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/6095/4/Fig1.pdf,0

New helium and argon abundance and isotope data are also reported to supplement previous studies (Füri et al., 2010; Barry et al., 2014), allowing elemental ratios (e.g., N2/40Ar* where 40Ar*=radiogenic 40Ar) to be calculated. Subglacial basaltic glasses with N2>2μcm3STP/g show a wide range in δ15N values, from -2.91 to +11.96‰ (vs. Air), with values >6‰ only observed at one locality in the Eastern Rift Zone. Elemental ratios involving N2, i.e., N2/3He, and N2/40Ar*, span several orders of magnitude from 2.5×105 to 9.0×107, and 32.8 to 1.46×106, respectively. In contrast, argon isotope ratios (40Ar/36Ar) are limited, ranging from air-like (~298.6) values up to 1330. Glasses exhibit a wide range in helium isotope ratios (8-26 RA), with clear distinctions between individual rift segments.A number of processes have extensively modified original mantle source N isotope and relative abundance compositions - most significantly air interaction, crustal contamination in some instances, and possibly degassing-induced fractionation. Under the assumption that the starting 4He/40Ar* production ratio of Iceland mantle is identical to the depleted MORB mantle (DMM), a filtering protocol for the entire N dataset, based upon 40Ar/36Ar and 4He/40Ar* ratios, was adopted to identify samples with unmodified δ15N values. Consequently, we identify 22 samples that define the Icelandic mantle N-isotope distribution (δ15N=-2.29 to +5.71‰). Using the filtered dataset, we investigate simple binary mixing scenarios involving N2/3He-N2/40Ar*-δ15N variations to identify mantle end-member compositions. Mixing scenarios are consistent with a recycled component in the Iceland mantle source, defined by a high and heterogeneous δ15N end-member. Moreover, this end-member is coupled to the high 3He/4He signature, and is characterized by He depletion and/or the presence of excess N2. These features strongly suggest the presence of recycled crustal N-component(s) integrated into and/or entrained by the Iceland plume source.These new results reveal the highly heterogeneous nature of nitrogen in the hybrid Iceland plume source, consistent with models based on trace elements and radiogenic isotopes that advocate for significant heterogeneity of recycled crustal component(s) sampled by the Iceland plume. A relatively young age of the recycled crustal material (possibly Phanerozoic) is consistent with the association of positive δ15N values and high N2/40Ar* ratios with constraints from radiogenic isotopes (e.g., Pb), thus indicating a relatively short time-interval (~108years) between subduction of crustal material and entrainment by the Iceland mantle plume.",,,10.1016/j.gca.2015.12.021,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84955272488,http://manuscript.elsevier.com/S0016703715007152/pdf/S0016703715007152.pdf,0

We urgently need mechanisms that can simultaneously tackle both biodiversity and carbon losses, with carbon-based payments for ecosystem services (e.g. REDD+) of particular interest. A critical question is whether such payments offer strong carbon–biodiversity co-benefits via the regrowth of forests on abandoned farmlands (carbon enhancements) for amphibians, which are the most threatened vertebrate group and reach the greatest richness of threatened and small-ranged species in the montane tropics (>1000 m a.s.l.). Here, we study changes in amphibian communities across a typical Andean habitat transition from cattle pasture through secondary forests (8–35 years) to primary forest. As secondary forests mature, they recovered the abundance, species richness, species composition and Red-listed (near threatened and threatened) species typically found in primary forest. By contrast, cattle pasture contained much lower richness of Red-listed species and a different species composition compared to forest. We then reveal positive relationships between carbon stocks and amphibian species richness and abundance, Red-listed species richness and abundance and the similarity of communities to primary forests, confirming significant carbon–biodiversity co-benefits. Our results underscore the high conservation value of secondary forests and the strong potential for carbon and biodiversity recovery.

This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.Background: It is often thought that random measurement error has a minor effect upon the results of an epidemiological survey. Theoretically, errors of measurement should always increase the spread of a distribution. Defining an illness by having a measurement outside an established healthy range will lead to an inflated prevalence of that condition if there are measurement errors. Methods and results: A Monte Carlo simulation was conducted of anthropometric assessment of children with malnutrition. Random errors of increasing magnitude were imposed upon the populations and showed that there was an increase in the standard deviation with each of the errors that became exponentially greater with the magnitude of the error. The potential magnitude of the resulting error of reported prevalence of malnutrition were compared with published international data and found to be of sufficient magnitude to make a number of surveys and the numerous reports and analyses that used these data unreliable. Conclusions: The effect of random error in public health surveys and the data upon which diagnostic cutoff points are derived to define ""health"" has been underestimated. Even quite modest random errors can more than double the reported prevalence of conditions such as malnutrition. Increasing sample size does not address this problem, and may even result in less accurate estimates. More attention needs to be paid to the selection, calibration and maintenance of instruments, measurer selection, training & supervision, routine estimation of the likely magnitude of errors using standardization tests, use of statistical likelihood of error to exclude data from analysis and full reporting of these procedures in order to judge the reliability of survey reports.","[""Analysis of Variance"",""Anthropometry"",""Child, Preschool"",""Data Interpretation, Statistical"",""Diagnostic Errors"",""Diagnostic Tests, Routine"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Infant"",""Male"",""Malnutrition"",""Models, Statistical"",""Nutrition Assessment"",""Observer Variation"",""Reproducibility of Results""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0168585,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85007371240,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168585&type=printable,0

This adaptability is often impaired after stroke, and this might contribute to the increased fall risk after stroke. To improve safe community ambulation, walking adaptability training might be beneficial after stroke. This study is designed to compare the effects of two interventions for improving walking speed and walking adaptability: treadmill-based C-Mill therapy (therapy with augmented reality) and the overground FALLS program (a conventional therapy program). We hypothesize that C-Mill therapy will result in better outcomes than the FALLS program, owing to its expected greater amount of walking practice. Methods: This is a single-center parallel group randomized controlled trial with pre-intervention, post-intervention, retention, and follow-up tests. Forty persons after stroke (≥3 months) with deficits in walking or balance will be included. Participants will be randomly allocated to either C-Mill therapy or the overground FALLS program for 5 weeks. Both interventions will incorporate practice of walking adaptability and will be matched in terms of frequency, duration, and therapist attention. Walking speed, as determined by the 10 Meter Walking Test, will be the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures will pertain to walking adaptability (10 Meter Walking Test with context or cognitive dual-task and Interactive Walkway assessments). Furthermore, commonly used clinical measures to determine walking ability (Timed Up-and-Go test), walking independence (Functional Ambulation Category), balance (Berg Balance Scale), and balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale) will be used, as well as a complementary set of walking-related assessments. The amount of walking practice (the number of steps taken per session) will be registered using the treadmill's inbuilt step counter (C-Mill therapy) and video recordings (FALLS program). This process measure will be compared between the two interventions. Discussion: This study will assess the effects of treadmill-based C-Mill therapy compared with the overground FALLS program and thereby the relative importance of the amount of walking practice as a key aspect of effective intervention programs directed at improving walking speed and walking adaptability after stroke.

This study aims to assess the prognostic ability of the recently published SPAN-100 index in a large cohort of stroke patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IV rtPA). Methods Using data from the prospective registery of all reperfusion treatments administered in Catalonia, we selected patients treated with IV rtPA alone between 2011 and 2012. The SPAN-100 index was calculated as the sum of age (years) and NIHSS score, and patients in the cohort were classified as SPAN-100 positive [≥ 100] or SPAN-100 negative [< 100]. We measured raw and adjusted rates of symptomatic intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH), mortality, and 3-month functional outcome (mRS 0-2) for each SPAN-100 category. Area under the ROC curve was calculated to predict the main outcome measures. Results We studied 1685 rtPA-treated patients, of whom 1405 (83%) were SPAN-100 negative. The SICH rates adjusted for sex, pre-stroke mRS, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, prior TIA/stroke and time to thrombolysis did not differ between groups, but likelihood of functional independence (mRS 0-2) at 3 months was nearly 8 times higher in the SPAN-100 negative group than in the positive group. Furthermore, the 3-month mortality rate was 5 times higher in the SPAN-100 positive group. ROC curve analysis showed high specificities for predicting both functional independence and 3-month mortality for a cut-off point of 100.

Carrier screening is defined here as the detection of carrier status of recessive diseases in couples or persons who do not have an a priori increased risk of being a carrier based on their or their partners' personal or family history. Expanded carrier screening offers carrier screening for multiple autosomal and X-linked recessive disorders, facilitated by new genetic testing technologies, and allows testing of individuals regardless of ancestry or geographic origin. Carrier screening aims to identify couples who have an increased risk of having an affected child in order to facilitate informed reproductive decision making. In previous decades, carrier screening was typically performed for one or few relatively common recessive disorders associated with significant morbidity, reduced life-expectancy and often because of a considerable higher carrier frequency in a specific population for certain diseases. New genetic testing technologies enable the expansion of screening to multiple conditions, genes or sequence variants.

However, since they operate in a wide variety of flight conditions, some of these have conflicting impacts on aircraft design process, as a single configuration may be efficient in one instance but perform poorly in others. A shape-shifting surface, or usually referred as 'morphing', potentially enables transport aircraft to reach maximum performance in any flight conditions. Within the framework of the Joint Technology Initiative Clean Sky (JTI-CS) project, and during the first phase of the Green Regional Aircraft Integrated Technological Demonstration (GRA-ITD), the authors focused on the design and technological demonstration of an innovative bi-modal morphing outer wing flap to be installed on the next generation open rotor green regional aircraft. A novel active rib layout was designed to enable the articulation of the entire flap structure by means of multi-box arrangement. In order to prove structural load-carrying capabilities with the reference to a relevant environment, the full-scale morphing flap was properly analyzed by means of detailed finite element model analysis. To the authors' knowledge, there is no morphing concept in literature based on a similar architecture based on distributed servo-mechanical actuators. Hence, a rational review of the potential problems associated with actuators off-design conditions has been conducted to investigate the maturity of the concept and safety issues concerning the flap ground static test. In addition, useful insights have been provided to effectively detect potential failure conditions in service.","[""Aircraft design process"",""Finite element model analysis"",""Hidden failure"",""Load carrying capability"",""Morphing"",""Off design condition"",""Static tests"",""Variable cambers""]","[""FEM"",""green regional aircraft"",""hidden failures"",""morphing flap"",""static test"",""variable camber flap""]",10.1109/ICMAE.2016.7549598,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988025270,,0

The interplay of these mechanisms produces instabilities in the stress field, leading to abrupt energy releases, i.e., earthquakes. As a consequence, the evolution towards instability before a single event is very difficult to monitor. On the other hand, collective behavior in stress transfer and relaxation within the Earth crust leads to emergent properties described by stable phenomenological laws for a population of many earthquakes in size, time and space domains. This observation has stimulated a statistical mechanics approach to earthquake occurrence, applying ideas and methods as scaling laws, universality, fractal dimension, renormalization group, to characterize the physics of earthquakes. In this review we first present a description of the phenomenological laws of earthquake occurrence which represent the frame of reference for a variety of statistical mechanical models, ranging from the spring-block to more complex fault models. Next, we discuss the problem of seismic forecasting in the general framework of stochastic processes, where seismic occurrence can be described as a branching process implementing space-time-energy correlations between earthquakes. In this context we show how correlations originate from dynamical scaling relations between time and energy, able to account for universality and provide a unifying description for the phenomenological power laws. Then we discuss how branching models can be implemented to forecast the temporal evolution of the earthquake occurrence probability and allow to discriminate among different physical mechanisms responsible for earthquake triggering. In particular, the forecasting problem will be presented in a rigorous mathematical framework, discussing the relevance of the processes acting at different temporal scales for different levels of prediction. In this review we also briefly discuss how the statistical mechanics approach can be applied to non-tectonic earthquakes and to other natural stochastic processes, such as volcanic eruptions and solar flares.",,,10.1016/j.physrep.2016.03.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962009432,,0

All rights reserved.In Europe as a whole, survival from skin malignant melanoma (SMM) has increased constantly since the 1980s. The aim of the SUDCAN collaborative study was to compare the trends in the 5-year net survival from SMM and in related excess mortality rate between six European Latin countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland). The data were extracted from the EUROCARE-5 database (end of follow-up: 01 January 2009). First, the net survival was studied over the 2000-2004 period using the Pohar-Perme estimator. For trend analyses, the study period was specific to each country. The results are reported from 1992 to 2004 in France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland and from 2000 to 2004 in Belgium and Portugal. The analyses were carried out using a flexible excess rate modeling. Over the 2000-2004 period, the 5-year net survival from SMM ranged from 79 (Portugal) to 90% (Switzerland). In all countries, net survival was higher in women versus men and in young versus old age groups. From 1992 to 2004, the 5-year net survival increased the most in the countries with the lowest survivals in 1992 (+9% in Italy and Spain vs. +2% in Switzerland or +4% in France). The differences between countries decreased between 1992 and 2004. Although survival increased to a lower or higher extent in all countries during the period studied, significant differences in net survival from SMM persisted among the six countries studied. Health policies should mainly enhance early diagnosis by increasing public awareness and with screening campaigns. Furthermore, new immunotherapies, which will be approved soon hopefully, should also be used to improve the outcomes of SMM treatment.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Belgium"",""Databases, Factual"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""France"",""Humans"",""Italy"",""Male"",""Melanoma"",""Middle Aged"",""Population Surveillance"",""Portugal"",""Registries"",""Skin Neoplasms"",""Spain"",""Survival Rate"",""Switzerland"",""Young Adult""]","[""Cancer registries"",""Europe"",""Excess mortality rate"",""Latin countries"",""Net survival"",""Skin melanoma"",""Trend analysis""]",10.1097/CEJ.0000000000000306,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85010194121,,0

It presents the design, deployment and evaluation of a heritage instrument, the “digital cultural biography” (DCB), which aims to allow future-oriented disciplines to make more historical and heritage informed decisions. Design/methodology/approach – The paper makes three contributions. First it presents a methodology to disseminate geographic information across disciplines by applying the biography of the landscape research strategy. Second it translates this methodology to a digital instrument, the DCB, which makes it possible to configure the historical and heritage features diachronically as well as spatially. And third it evaluates the added value of this instrument by organizing a design concourse and applying various evaluation methods. The Roman neighbourhood of Testaccio functions as the use case for this study. Findings – The research shows a high potential to use digital tooling based on geospatial technologies to support the dialogue between future and past-oriented disciplines.

This paper identifies, in the context of Scottish policy, how different professional discourses of wellbeing have migrated into education policy and it examines how this relates to learning. Taking a view of policy enactment as recontextualisation, the paper also explores how teachers and policy actors understand their role in supporting wellbeing. The paper shows how Scottish policy portrays wellbeing as personal skills of self-management (discourses of health promotion, and of social and emotional literacy) fostered through a caring environment. Health and wellbeing is represented as a prerequisite for learning, rather than an outcome of education. The contribution of teaching and learning to childhood wellbeing is over-shadowed. While some interviewees repeated or reinforced the main messages of policy, others took a more nuanced view, identifying how a high quality learning experience could enhance the lives of children in the present and the future. Moreover, teacher interviews showed how good relationships were not simply a foundation for learning; they were also a product of the shared pedagogical endeavour. The paper concludes by suggesting that the relationship between learning and wellbeing can be considered at different levels. At a basic level psychological and physical wellbeing enhances opportunities to engage in education, but at a more complex level, the choices that teachers make about content and pedagogy can create opportunities for young people to lead lives they have reason to value.",,,10.1002/berj.3211,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84946018271,http://hdl.handle.net/2164/9561,0

Most long-term research focuses on large North American and northern European lakes, but climate forcing south of the Alps seems to be different. Furthermore, lake restoration frequently involves smaller lakes (<10 km2) that are often overlooked in long-term limnological studies despite their importance for local stakeholders. We investigated the effects of climate change and re-oligotrophication on the thermal structure of Lake Caldonazzo (Italy – southern Alps; area = 5.6 km2; maximum depth = 49 m) for the years 1973–2014. The lake received untreated wastewaters from its catchment until the mid-1970s, leading to algal blooms, severe hypolimnetic anoxia and fish kills. Afterwards, local government initiated sewage removal that was completed in 1989. We used transparency, phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations as trophic indicators, air temperature and global circulation indices as climatic indicators and epilimnion depth and temperature, hypolimnion temperature, thermocline depth and Schmidt stability as indicators of thermal structure. For these time series, we determined trend patterns and timing of change points. Epilimnetic temperatures showed an upward shift in 1985. Here, we present an alternative explanation for this observed change that generally has been attributed to global circulation indices. Epilimnetic depth continually increased until 1989, but less markedly afterwards. We suggest that until restoration continued, the increasingly deeper epilimnion absorbed the incoming heat of climate change without increasing epilimnetic temperature. After sewage removal, however, the epilimnion did not deepen enough to prevent an upward shift in epilimnetic temperature. We linked the deepening of the epilimnion to increased water transparency. Hypolimnetic temperatures showed a downward shift in 1998. Hypolimnetic cooling has been seldom observed and was in our case related to specific interactions between re-oligotrophication, climate and lake depth. Penetration of incident solar radiation was insufficient to heat the hypolimnion (>50% of lake volume), while deeper mixing released accumulated heat from the previous season and earlier stratification trapped colder water in the hypolimnion. We suggest that these combined effects resulted in a decrease in hypolimnetic temperature. Our study indicated that re-oligotrophication mitigated the effects of climate change, but when re-oligotrophication was no longer progressing, the effects of climate on thermal structure were perceivable. These changes were site specific and not tied to atmospheric circulation indices. Epilimnetic warming in particular will have repercussions on plankton dynamics. Management of non-point sources of nutrients will become increasingly important to limit the eutrophication-like effects of climate change, especially in the case of a warming epilimnion.",,"[""Alps"",""epilimnetic warming"",""hypolimnion cooling"",""mixing"",""trophic indicators""]",10.1111/fwb.12819,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84985946705,,0

Two parameters express the nasal functions: (1) mucociliary clearance (MCC), and (2) the pH and its stability. MCC is the main factor that defines the time of pollen transition on the nasal mucosa and, therefore, the amount of the allergen glycoprotein elution. Objectives: We hypothesized that the nasal wash efficacy could be due to the reduction of contact time of the grass pollen on the nasal mucosa (improving MCC). Methods: Forty patients with seasonal grass pollen oculorhinitis were randomized in two groups: 20 received three times daily nasal rinsing with hypertonic solution buffered to pH 6.1, before and during the peak pollen season in 2015 (active group), and another 20 patients were allocated to the control group and received no nasal treatment. The daily symptoms score and the use of oral antihistamines when required were evaluated during the grass pollen peak season. All the patients completed the study. Results: In comparison with the control group, in the active group, a significant decrease of both nasal symptoms (p = 0.01) and consumption of antihistamines (p = 0.035) was found. Furthermore, the MCC was significantly worse (p = 0.011) only in the control group. Conclusion: The nasal treatment maintained the efficiency of the MCC in the patients in the active group, who showed a significant reduction of symptoms and medication score. The MCC decreased the transit time of the pollen on the nasal mucosa, which favored an elution of the allergenic proteins.","[""Administration, Intranasal"",""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Allergens"",""Androstadienes"",""Eosinophils"",""Female"",""Fluticasone"",""Glucocorticoids"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Mucociliary Clearance"",""Nasal Mucosa"",""Nebulizers and Vaporizers"",""Poaceae"",""Pollen"",""Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal"",""Seasons"",""Therapeutic Irrigation"",""Young Adult""]","[""Grass pollen peak"",""Hypertonic solution"",""Mucociliary"",""Mucociliary clearance"",""Nasal douche"",""Nasal rinsing"",""Nasal rinsing"",""Pollen season"",""Rhinitis""]",10.2500/ajra.2016.30.4383,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85014040733,,0

In mountainous regions like the Alps, soils require specific attention as they provide a large variety of ecological functions, but also because of their vulnerability. However, pedological research and the collection of soil data in the Alps are still limited. On the one hand, there are specific methodological problems linked to the surveying, interpretation, and classification of Alpine soils due to their high variability over short spatial ranges and the peculiarities of the Alpine environment in general. On the other hand, the process of collecting soil data and mapping soils, as well as the soil classification systems used, significantly differs among the Alpine countries. The Alpine Convention therefore requires data harmonization as a basis for national and cross-country collaborations, soil monitoring, and sustainable management.This paper is an initial national expert-based review, which deals with the status of soil classification and soil mapping and related problems in the Alpine region. In the first part we highlight the current state of soil databases and soil maps in the Alpine area, as well as efforts toward soil data harmonization. We summarize the national soil mapping and soil inventory programs, monitoring activities (e.g., Soil Quality Monitoring, Soil Management Survey, Forest Monitoring), and soil information systems available in the main Alpine countries Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Switzerland. Second, we present the soil classification systems which are in use in the Alpine area. It is discussed to what extent these systems can reflect the characteristics of Alpine soils. In this context, we also examine the relevance of organic matter and humus forms. We then outline problems of comparability between the classification systems as well as challenges to classifying Alpine soils in general. In the third part - as soil classification and soil mapping are two different matters from a methodical point of view - we highlight basic challenges to soil surveys in the Alpine environment.We conclude that Alpine-wide shared soil site mapping and soil classification standards covering the specifics of Alpine soils are lacking. Thus, the main aim for the international management of Alpine soil resources should be to develop a framework for the basic soil information that is to be gathered by means of cross-border collection in the entire Alpine space, and to harmonize the already existing data. The former should include an upgrade of an existing international soil classification, e.g., the World Reference Base WRB (IUSS, 2014).","[""Alpine convention"",""European Alps"",""Soil classification"",""Soil data"",""Soil mapping""]","[""Alpine convention"",""Alpine soils"",""European Alps"",""Soil classification"",""Soil data"",""Soil mapping""]",10.1016/j.geoderma.2015.08.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84948809051,,0

Schistosomiasis, a NTD, is a tropical and subtropical disease caused by the trematode Schistosoma mansoni (Africa, Middle East, Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela, Suriname), japonicum (China, Indonesia, the Philippines), mekongi (several districts of Cambodia and the Lao People's Democratic Republic), intercalatum and guianensis (areas of tropical rainforests in Central Africa) and hematobium (Middle East Africa, Corsica, France) whose adult forms inhabit the mesenteric vessels of the host, while the intermediate forms are found in the aquatic gastropod snails of the genus Biomphalaria. Currently, praziquantel (PZQ) is the first line drug chosen for the treatment of schistosomiasis according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Model List of Essential Medicines, 2015. PZQ chemotherapy is considered to be the most important development for decades in the treatment of schistosomiasis. Beside the PZQ, oxamniquine (OXA) has been first described in 1969 and launched in Brazil by Pfizer under the name of Mansil® for oral administration. It has a lower cost when compared to PZQ, being active in the intestinal and hepatosplenic infections caused exclusively by S. mansoni, single species in Brazil. Both PZQ and OXA have limitations, as low efficacy in the treatment of acute schistosomiasis, low activity against S. mansoni in immature stages and resistance or tolerance, which is the reason why further research are still necessary for the development of a second generation of antischistosomal drugs. For the development of new PZQ analogs, three main strategies can be adopted: (a) synthesis and evaluation of PZQ analogues; (b) rational design of new pharmacophores; (c) discovery of new active compounds from screening programs on a large scale. Such (b) approach is difficult as the target of PZQ still unknown, the synthesis of new active analogues is possible from delineation of structure-activity relationships for PZQ. Thus, we proposed for a review article an accurate analysis of PZQ and OXA medicinal properties and uses, focusing on the pharmacochemical aspects of both drugs through 178 bibliographic references. The mechanisms of action will be discussed, with the latest information available in the literature (for the first time in the case of the oxamniquine). Cases of resistance are also discussed. As both drugs are available as a racemic mixture the biological impact of their stereochemistry to activity and side effects are reviewed. The results obtained for the combination of PZQ and artemisinin derivatives against immature worms are also introduced in the discussion. Using the information about more than 200 PZQ new derivatives synthetized during almost 35 years since its discovery, a deep structure-activity relationship (SAR) is also proposed in this study.","[""Animals"",""Chemistry, Pharmaceutical"",""Dose-Response Relationship, Drug"",""Humans"",""Molecular Structure"",""Neglected Diseases"",""Oxamniquine"",""Praziquantel"",""Schistosoma mansoni"",""Structure-Activity Relationship""]","[""Medicinal chemistry"",""Oxamniquine"",""Praziquantel"",""Schistosomiasis""]",10.1016/j.bmc.2017.04.031,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019019520,,0

A 4-step evaluation process included a systematic literature search for the identification of potential QIs and the documentation of scientific evidence, physical meetings of an ad hoc multidisciplinarity International Development Group, an internal validation of the targets and scoring system, and an external review process involving physicians and patients. Results Ten structural, process, or outcome indicators were selected. Quality indicators 1 to 3 are related to achievement of complete cytoreduction, caseload in the center, training, and experience of the surgeon. Quality indicators 4 to 6 are related to the overall management, including active participation to clinical research, decision-making process within a structured multidisciplinary team, and preoperative workup. Quality indicator 7 addresses the high value of adequate perioperative management. Quality indicators 8 to 10 highlight the need of recording pertinent information relevant to improvement of quality. An ESGO-approved template for the operative report has been designed. Quality indicators were described using a structured format specifying what the indicator is measuring, measurability specifications, and targets. Each QI was associated with a score, and an assessment form was built. Conclusions The ESGO quality criteria can be used for self-assessment, for institutional or governmental quality assurance programs, and for the certification of centers. Quality indicators and corresponding targets give practitioners and health administrators a quantitative basis for improving care and organizational processes in the surgical management of advanced ovarian cancer.","[""Female"",""Gynecologic Surgical Procedures"",""Humans"",""Ovarian Neoplasms"",""Quality Indicators, Health Care""]","[""Cytoreduction"",""Ovarian cancer"",""Quality assurance""]",10.1097/IGC.0000000000000767,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84985918226,,0

The microbial safety in water reuse, especially with respect to pathogenic viruses, is still a concern for water consumers. Membrane filtration can achieve sufficient removal of pathogenic viruses without disinfection byproducts, but the required energy is intensive. In this study, we graft-polymerized zwitterionic SPP ([3-(methacryloylamino) propyl] dimethyl (3-sulfopropyl) ammonium hydroxide) on a 150 kDa ultrafiltration polyethersulfone membrane to achieve a significantly higher virus removal. The redox-initiated graft-polymerization was performed in an aqueous solution during filtration of the monomer and initiators, allowing for functionalizing the membrane pores with hydrophilic polySPP. Bacteriophage MS2 and human adenovirus type 2 (HAdV-2) were used as surrogates for pathogenic human norovirus and human adenovirus. The grafting resulted in ∼18% loss of the membrane permeability but an increase of 4 log10 in HAdV-2 removal and 3 log10 in MS2 removal. The pristine and the grafted membranes were both conditioned with soluble microbial products (SMP) extracted from a full-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) in order to test the virus removal after fouling the membranes. After fouling, the HAdV-2 removal by the grafted membrane was 1 log10 higher than that of the pristine membrane. For MS2, the grafted membrane after fouling with SMP achieved an additional 5 log10 removal compared to the unmodified membrane. The simple graft-polymerization functionalization of commercialized membrane achieving enhanced virus removal efficiency highlights the promise of membrane filtration for pathogen control in potable water reuse.","[""Graft polymerization"",""Membrane bio reactor (MBR)"",""Polyethersulfone membrane"",""Repulsion force"",""Soluble microbial products"",""Ultra-filtration membranes"",""Virus removal"",""Zwitterionic"",""Bioreactors"",""Filtration"",""Hydrogels"",""Membranes, Artificial"",""Polymers"",""Ultrafiltration"",""Water Purification""]","[""Graft-polymerization"",""Repulsion force"",""Virus removal"",""Zwitterionic""]",10.1016/j.watres.2017.03.023,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85015402267,,0

In this study, we have assessed the ecotoxicity of four engineered Fe nanomaterials, specifically, Nano-Goethite, Trap-Ox Fe-zeolites, Carbo-Iron® and FerMEG12, developed within the European FP7 project NanoRem for sub-surface remediation towards a test battery consisting of eight ecotoxicity tests on bacteria (V. fisheri, E. coli), algae (P. subcapitata, Chlamydomonas sp.), crustaceans (D. magna), worms (E. fetida, L. variegatus) and plants (R. sativus, L. multiflorum). The tested materials are commercially available and include Fe oxide and nanoscale zero valent iron (nZVI), but also hybrid products with Fe loaded into a matrix. All but one material, a ball milled nZVI (FerMEG12), showed no toxicity in the test battery when tested in concentrations up to 100 mg/L, which is the cutoff for hazard labeling in chemicals regulation in Europe. However it should be noted that Fe nanomaterials proved challenging to test adequately due to their turbidity, aggregation and sedimentation behavior in aqueous media. This paper provides a number of recommendations concerning future testing of Fe nanomaterials and discusses environmental risk assessment considerations related to these.","[""Eco-toxicology"",""Environmental risk assessment"",""NanoRem"",""Nanoremediation"",""nZVI"",""Animals"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Environmental Pollution"",""Environmental Restoration and Remediation"",""Europe"",""Iron"",""Metal Nanoparticles"",""Toxicity Tests"",""Zeolites""]","[""Ecotoxicology"",""Environmental risk assessment"",""Iron nanomaterials"",""NanoRem"",""Nanoremediation"",""nZVI""]",10.1016/j.chemosphere.2017.05.060,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019237734,https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/132146746/1_s2.0_S0045653517307646_main.pdf,0

Mangroves along the coastlines are ecologically important areas and vital nursing grounds for many aquatic species, several of which are of high economic value in Mozambique. Barred mudskipper (Periophthalmus argentilineatus), Jarbua fish (Terapon jarbua), Indian white prawn (Penaeus indicus) and the clam Meretrix meretrix were collected at three mangrove sites in the Maputo Bay area. This was complemented with samplings of the freshwater fish Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus), which was collected from three sampling sites along rivers in the surroundings of Maputo and from three sites along the Olifants and Limpopo River. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, which is an established biomarker for organophosphates and carbamate pesticides, was measured in brain and liver tissue in fish, and hepatopancreas tissue in prawn and clam. Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity was also analyzed. Freshwater samples for pesticide analyses were collected in order to get an initial understanding of the classes and levels of pesticides present in aquatic systems in Mozambique. In addition to field samplings two 48-h exposure experiments were also conducted where the Indian white prawn and Barred mudskipper were exposed to malathion, and Mozambique tilapia exposed to malathion and diazinon. Field results show a significant decrease in AChE activity in fish from four of the sampling sites suggesting that pesticides present in water could be one stressor potentially affecting aquatic organisms negatively. The 48 h exposure experiment results showed a clear dose-response relationship of AChE activity in mudskipper and tilapia suggesting these species as suitable as sentinel species in environmental studies.","[""Acetylcholineesterase"",""Butyrylcholinesterase"",""Dose response relationships"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Invertebrates"",""Mangrove"",""Oreochromis Mossambicus"",""Organophosphates"",""Acetylcholinesterase"",""Animals"",""Aquatic Organisms"",""Biomarkers"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Mozambique"",""Pesticides"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical"",""Wetlands""]","[""Acetylcholineesterase"",""Fish"",""Invertebrates"",""Mangrove"",""Monitoring"",""Organophosphates""]",10.1016/j.marenvres.2016.05.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84991687282,,0

Our study therefore aimed to assess: (1) mortality in AS versus the general population, and (2) predictors of death in the AS population. Methods Nationwide cohorts of patients with AS diagnosed at rheumatology or internal medicine outpatient clinics (n=8600) and age-matched, sex-matched and county-matched general population comparators (n=40â €..460) were identified from the National Patient Register and the census register, respectively. The follow-up period began on 1 January 2006 or at the first date of registered diagnosis thereafter and extended until death, emigration or 31 December 2012, whichever occurred first. Socioeconomic variables, AS-related clinical manifestations, joint surgery, comorbidities and medication were identified from other national registers. Cox regression models were used to determine mortality and predictors for death in the AS cohort. Results There were 496 deaths in the AS cohort and 1533 deaths in the control cohort resulting in an age-Adjusted and sex-Adjusted HR of 1.60 (95% CI 1.44 to 1.77), with increased mortality for men (age-Adjusted HR=1.53, 95% CI 1.36 to 1.72) and women (age-Adjusted HR=1.83, 95% CI 1.50 to 2.22). Within the AS cohort, statistically significant predictors for death were a lower level of education, general comorbidities (diabetes, infections, cardiovascular, pulmonary and malignant diseases) and previous hip replacement surgery. Conclusions Mortality was increased for male and female patients with AS.

A framed field experiment with credit groups in Tanzania, eliciting demand for group versus individual insurance, attributes this to a social dilemma. In a context of joint liability, insurance is a public good because clients can rely on contributions from group members to cope with health shocks. We hypothesize that clients have a private incentive to free-ride and forgo individual insurance even when full enrollment optimizes group welfare. The binding nature of group insurance eliminates such free-riding. Our experiment yields substantial support for this hypothesis. Whereas the demand for group insurance is high, a substantial share of clients forgoes individual insurance and relies on peers to repay their loan when falling ill. Group insurance can potentially increase low take-up rates.",,"[""Health insurance"",""Microfinance"",""Public goods experiment"",""Risk-sharing""]",10.1016/j.jebo.2016.03.003,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964679978,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jebo.2016.03.003,0

Seed predators may, therefore, adopt foraging strategies that favor dietary diversity and resource monitoring, rather than efficient energy intake, as suggested by optimal foraging theory. We tested whether fine-scale space use by a small-group-living seed predator-the bald-faced saki monkey (Pithecia irrorata)-reflected optimization of short-term foraging efficiency, maximization of daily dietary diversity, and/or responses to the threat of territorial encroachment by neighboring groups. Food patches across home ranges of five adjacent saki groups were widely spread, but areas with higher densities of stems or food species were not allocated greater feeding time. Foraging patterns-specifically, relatively long daily travel paths that bypassed available fruiting trees and relatively short feeding bouts in undepleted food patches-suggest a strategy that maximizes dietary diversification, rather than ""optimal"" foraging. Travel distance was unrelated to the proportion of seeds in the diet. Moreover, while taxonomically diverse, the daily diets of our study groups were no more species-rich than randomly derived diets based on co-occurring available food species. Sakis preferentially used overlapping areas of their HRs, within which adjacent groups shared many food trees, yet the density of food plants or food species in these areas was no greater than in other HR areas. The high likelihood of depletion by neighboring groups of otherwise enduring food sources may encourage monitoring of peripheral food patches in overlap areas, even if at the expense of immediate energy intake, suggesting that between-group competition is a key driver of fine-scale home range use in sakis.","[""Animals"",""Appetitive Behavior"",""Diet"",""Feeding Behavior"",""Peru"",""Pitheciidae"",""Seeds"",""Social Behavior"",""Spatial Behavior"",""Territoriality""]","[""Day path"",""Foraging"",""Pitheciines"",""Ranging behavior"",""Territoriality""]",10.1002/ajp.22407,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84925707609,,0

The risk of postoperative pulmonary complications is high and therefore standard postoperative care involves respiratory physiotherapy. The purpose of this systematic review is to create an overview of the evidence on respiratory physiotherapy after lung resection surgery on mortality rate (within 30 days) and postoperative pulmonary complications. Methods and analysis The review will include randomized or quasi-randomized controlled studies investigating the effect of all types of respiratory physiotherapy on mortality and postoperative pulmonary complications after lung resection surgery. Furthermore, the effect of respiratory physiotherapy is evaluated on secondary outcomes such as length of hospital stay, lung volumes and function, and adverse events. The method of the planned review is described in this paper. The literature search will include the databases PubMed, Cochrane (Central), Embase, Cinahl and PEDro.

We therefore performed an IPD meta-analysis on the association between standardized serum 25(OH)D and mortality. Methods In a European consortium of eight prospective studies, including seven general population cohorts, we used the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP) protocols to standardize 25(OH)D data. Meta-analyses using a one step procedure on IPD were performed to study associations of 25(OH)D with all-cause mortality as the primary outcome, and with cardiovascular and cancer mortality as secondary outcomes. This meta-analysis is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02438488. Findings We analysed 26916 study participants (median age 61.6 years, 58% females) with a median 25(OH)D concentration of 53.8 nmol/L. During a median follow-up time of 10.5 years, 6802 persons died. Compared to participants with 25(OH)D concentrations of 75 to 99.99 nmol/L, the adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence interval) for mortality in the 25(OH)D groups with 40 to 49.99, 30 to 39.99, and <30 nmol/L were 1.15 (1.00-1.29), 1.33 (1.16-1.51), and 1.67 (1.44-1.89), respectively. We observed similar results for cardiovascular mortality, but there was no significant linear association between 25(OH)D and cancer mortality. There was also no significantly increased mortality risk at high 25(OH)D levels up to 125 nmol/L. Interpretation In the first IPD meta-analysis using standardized measurements of 25(OH)D we observed an association between low 25(OH)D and increased risk of all-cause mortality.

Cabrera and water voles show a metapopulation-like structure in Mediterranean farmland, where they are known to segregate along space, habitat, and time axes within habitat patches. Here, we assess whether segregation also occurs among and within landscapes, and how this is influenced by patch-network and matrix composition. We surveyed 75 landscapes, each covering 78 ha, where we mapped all habitat patches potentially suitable for Cabrera and water voles, and the area effectively occupied by each species (extent of occupancy). The relatively large water vole tended to be the sole occupant of landscapes with high habitat amount but relatively low patch density (i.e., with a few large patches), and with a predominantly agricultural matrix, whereas landscapes with high patch density (i.e., many small patches) and low agricultural cover, tended to be occupied exclusively by the small Cabrera vole. The two species tended to co-occur in landscapes with intermediate patch-network and matrix characteristics, though their extents of occurrence were negatively correlated after controlling for environmental effects.

Excessive bleeding after cardiac surgical procedures sometimes necessitates reexploration. This study described the associations between reexploration for bleeding and morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgical procedures. In addition, independent predictors of reexploration were identified. Methods. This retrospective observational study based on prospectively registered data included 5,392 consecutive cardiac surgical operations performed from 2009 through 2013. Reexplorations for bleeding within 24 hours of surgical procedures and perioperative morbidity and mortality (30-day, 90-day, and from 90 days until the end of follow-up) were registered. Factors independently associated with mortality, morbidity, and reexploration were identified with multivariable logistic or Cox regression models. Mean follow-up time was 2.4 years (range 0 to 5 years). Results. In this study, 320 patients (6.0%) underwent surgical reexploration. These patients had higher unadjusted mortality at 30 days, 90 days, and more than 90 days (all p < 0.0001). The increased risk remained statistically significant after adjustment for other risk factors at 90 days (odds ratio [OR]: 1.82; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13 to 2.93; p = 0.013) and at more than 90 days (hazard ratio: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.14 to 2.61; p = 0.010). Reexploration was, after adjustment, independently associated with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (>24 hours), perioperative stroke, perioperative renal injury, need for dialysis postoperatively, prolonged mechanical ventilation (>72 hours), and postoperative mechanical circulation support. Independent risk factors for reexploration were low body mass index, high EuroSCORE, low preoperative fibrinogen plasma concentration, long extracorporeal circulation time, combined valve and coronary artery bypass operations, and dual antiplatelet therapy less than 5 days preoperatively. Conclusions. Excessive bleeding leading to reexploration is associated with a twofold increased early postoperative mortality rate. Reexploration for bleeding is also associated with mortality beyond 90 days after operation.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Aged, 80 and over"",""Cardiac Surgical Procedures"",""Child"",""Female"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""Humans"",""Incidence"",""Intensive Care Units"",""Length of Stay"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Odds Ratio"",""Postoperative Hemorrhage"",""Prognosis"",""Reoperation"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Risk Factors"",""Survival Rate"",""Sweden"",""Time Factors"",""Young Adult""]",,10.1016/j.athoracsur.2016.01.006,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84961773386,http://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/S0003497516000072/pdf,0

Objective To compare mortality rates in patients receiving ET alone versus ET + RAD. Design, settings, and participants From 1996 to 2002, 875 Scandinavian patients with high-risk (90%) or intermediate PCa were randomized to ET or ET + RAD (The Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Group-7). After 3 mo with total androgen blockade in all patients, all individuals continued lifelong antiandrogen monotherapy. Those randomized to ET + RAD started prostate radiotherapy (70 Gy) at 3 mo. Outcome, measurements and statistical analysis PCa-specific 15-yr mortality represented the primary endpoint. Assessment of the combination treatment effect and prognostic factors was performed in competing risk analyses and Cox proportional-hazard models. Intervention RAD added to ET. Results and limitations With a median observation time of 12 yr, the 15-yr PCa-specific mortality rates were 34% (95% confidence interval, 29–39%) and 17% (95% confidence interval, 13–22%) in the ET and ET + RAD arms respectively (p < 0.001). Compared with the ET arm, the median overall survival in the ET + RAD arm was prolonged by 2.4 yr. Treatment with ET alone, age ≥65 yr and increasing histology grade independently increased the risk of PCa-specific and overall mortality. Limitations include nonformal evaluation of comorbidity, the inability to calculate progression-free survival, and lack of information about salvage therapy and toxicity. Conclusions In patients with nonmetastatic locally advanced or aggressive PCa, ET + RAD reduces the absolute risk of PCa-specific death by 17% at 15 yr compared with ET alone; the comparable 15-yr PCa-specific mortality rates being 17% and 34%. The results warrant a phase 3 study comparing ET + RAD with radical prostatectomy in high-risk PCa.

Here we performed a 40-day laboratory microcosm experiment to assess the individual and combined effects of drought and the model fungicide tebuconazole (TBZ) on leaf litter decomposition (LLD), a fundamental biogeochemical process in freshwater ecosystems. Starting out from a worst-case scenario perspective, leaf-associated microbial communities were exposed to severe drought conditions (four 5-day drought periods alternated with 4-day immersion periods) and/or a chronic exposure to TBZ (nominal concentration of 20 μg L-1). We assessed the direct effects of drought and fungicide on the structure (biomass, diversity) and activity (extracellular enzymatic potential) of fungal and bacterial assemblages colonizing leaves. We also investigated indirect effects on the feeding rates of the amphipod Gammarus fossarum on leaves previously exposed to drought and/or TBZ contamination. Results indicate a stronger effect of drought stress than fungicide contamination under the experimental conditions applied. Indeed, the drought stress strongly impacted microbial community structure and activities, inhibiting the LLD process and leading to cascading effects on macroinvertebrate feeding. However, despite the lack of significant effect of TBZ applied alone, the effects of drought on microbial functions (i.e., decrease in LLD and in enzymatic activities) and on Gammarus feeding rates were more pronounced when drought and TBZ stresses were applied together. In a perspective of ecological risk assessment and ecosystem management for sustainability, these findings stress the need for deeper insight into how multiple stressors can affect the functioning of aquatic ecosystems and associated services.","[""Amphipoda"",""Animals"",""Bacterial Physiological Phenomena"",""Droughts"",""Ecosystem"",""Environmental Microbiology"",""Feeding Behavior"",""Fresh Water"",""Fungi"",""Fungicides, Industrial"",""Microbiota"",""Plant Leaves"",""Stress, Physiological"",""Triazoles"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Aquatic food web"",""Biodiversity-ecosystem function relationship"",""Microbial communities"",""Microbial ecotoxicology"",""Multistress"",""Shredders""]",10.1016/j.aquatox.2016.01.012,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957105439,https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01804836/file/ly2016-pub00046834.pdf,0

The commercial perennial grass Miscanthus × giganteus is a leading biomass crop; however, its response to salt stress is largely unknown. Miscanthus × giganteus was grown in pots irrigated with nine different NaCl concentrations (0, 2.86, 5.44, 7.96, 10.65, 14.68, 17.5, 19.97 and 22.4 dS m−1). Biomass yield was reduced by 50% at 10.65 dS m−1 NaCl. Root dry matter inhibition occurred at the highest salt concentration tested, while rhizome dry weight and the ratios of root/rhizome and below-/above-ground dry matter were not affected by elevated salinity. The accumulative effect of increasing salinity reduced stem height and elongation, while photosynthesis was reduced to a smaller extent. The duration and strength of salinity exacerbated the reduction. Water use efficiency (WUE) was maintained except at the highest salinity and plants maintained stomatal conductance (gs) and leaf water content at low to moderate salinity. Miscanthus × giganteus showed strong induction of the osmoprotectant, proline and no significant increase in malondialdehyde content under increasing salinity. The ash content in leaves, increased, reducing the biomass quality at high salinity concentrations. The effects of salinity on the yield and the availability of land area in European geographical area for agriculture were investigated.

This study explores why and how the costs of community-owned projects differ from commercially-owned projects by examining the case of onshore wind in the UK. Based on cross-sectoral literature on the challenges of community ownership, cost differences are attributed to six facets of an organisation or project: internal processes, internal knowledge and skills, perceived local legitimacy of the project, perceived external legitimacy of the organisation, investor motivation and expectations, and finally, project scale. These facets impact not only development costs but also project development times and the probability that projects pass certain critical stages in the development process. Using survey-based and secondary cost data on community and commercial projects in the UK, a model is developed to show the overall impact of cost, time and risk differences on the value of a hypothetical 500 kW onshore wind project. The results show that the main factors accounting for differences are higher pre-planning costs and additional risks born by community projects, and suggest that policy interventions may be required to place community- owned projects on a level playing field with commercial projects.","[""Community energy"",""Comparative analysis"",""Economic costs"",""External legitimacies"",""Level playing fields"",""Onshore winds"",""Ownership"",""Renewable energy generation""]","[""Community energy"",""Economic costs"",""Onshore wind"",""Ownership"",""Risk""]",10.1016/j.enpol.2017.03.070,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85017437495,,0

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The prevalence of diabetes, defined as self-reported or fasting glycemia ≥7 mmol/L, was documented in 119,666 adults from three high-income (HIC), seven uppermiddle-income (UMIC), four lower-middle-income (LMIC), and four low-income (LIC) countries. Relationships between diabetes and its risk factors within these country groupings were assessed using multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Age- and sex-adjusted diabetes prevalences were highest in the poorer countries and lowest in the wealthiest countries (LIC 12.3%, UMIC 11.1%, LMIC 8.7%, and HIC 6.6%; P < 0.0001). In the overall population, diabetes risk was higher with a 5-year increase in age (odds ratio 1.29 [95% CI 1.28-1.31]), male sex (1.19 [1.13-1.25]), urban residency (1.24 [1.11-1.38]), low versus high education level (1.10 [1.02-1.19]), low versus high physical activity (1.28 [1.20-1.38]), family history of diabetes (3.15 [3.00-3.31]), higher waist-to-hip ratio (highest vs. lowest quartile; 3.63 [3.33-3.96]), and BMI (≥35 vs. <25 kg/m2; 2.76 [2.52-3.03]).

Central European river networks have been fragmented over decades and populations of sensitive species have been eradicated from large parts of the catchments. Objectives: Identification of remaining source sites (i.e., near-natural river stretches with populations of sensitive organisms) allows to protect them and reconnect them to degraded or restored stretches. We developed an approach to identify source sites of fish and benthic invertebrates and applied it to large parts of Germany. Methods: The approach is based on identifying source sites from sampling data (5919 benthic invertebrate and 2584 fish monitoring sites) depending on the occurring number of sensitive species. For river stretches that have not been sampled we conducted statistical modeling with environmental data (e.g. land use, river habitat data) using boosted regression trees to identify source sites characterized by similar environmental conditions. Results: The results are presented as maps on the level of the federal states. Statistical modeling allowed identification of stream type-specific environmental parameters and their thresholds. The maps allow a visual estimation of the recolonisation potential for river sections considered for restoration.

The increased use of lithium has generated only scarce studies on its concentrations in ambient waters and on its effects on aquatic organisms. Only few contributions have focused on the toxicity of lithium in marine organisms (such as marine animals, algae and vegetables), showing that the toxic effect depends on the animal species. In the present study we describe the morphological and the molecular effects of lithium chloride (LiCl), using the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus as a model organism. We show that LiCl, if added to the eggs before fertilization, induces malformations in the embryos in a dose-dependent manner. We have also followed by RT qPCR the expression levels of thirty seven genes (belonging to different classes of functional processes, such as stress, development, differentiation, skeletogenesis and detoxifications) to identify the molecular targets of LiCl.

Although treatment is covered by health insurance and is thus available for all patients at no cost, treatment refusal and treatment discontinuation have been observed. However, no data providing numbers and outcomes for developed countries have been published thus far. Procedure: A questionnaire-based survey was performed among German pediatric oncology centers to ascertain the number of treatment refusals among pediatric patients who were diagnosed between January 2008 and December 2009 in Germany. Results: Questionnaires from 70 of 73 centers were available, and of these 13 centers reported a total of 15 cases of treatment refusal or discontinuation within this 2-year period. Five of the 15 patients died, 7 of 15 were still alive, and the current status of 3 of 15 patients was unknown. Diseases were heterogeneous. Six of the 15 parents refused treatment for their children initially, 8 of 15 discontinued during the course of treatment. Five patients were treated after parental custody had been withdrawn due to the lack of compliance. All these five patients survived. Parents’ reasons given for refusal or discontinuation of treatment were related to personal health beliefs and coping strategies. Conclusions: Although treatment refusal or discontinuation is rare, it is accompanied by a high mortality rate.

The zooplankton abundances on the south Iceland shelf show characteristic sub-decadal variability, which closely reflect the oceanic abundances of the ecologically most important zooplankton species – Calanus finmarchicus. Much higher abundances of this species are observed during years when the winter mixed layer depths (MLD) in the Labrador-Irminger Sea, and over the Reykjanes Ridge are deep. Furthermore, a tight relationship is identified between on-shelf zooplankton abundances and lateral shifts of the biologically productive subarctic front southwest of Iceland. Thus, we suggest that northeastward expansion of the subpolar gyre results in biologically productive periods in the waters southwest of Iceland – both oceanic and on the shelf. In addition to local atmospheric forcing, we find that the MLD and frontal position are also impacted by remote heat losses and convection in the Labrador Sea, through northward advection of unstable mode waters. The sub-decadal oceanic and on-shelf biological production peaks are possibly predictable by half a year (local winter convection to subsequent summer production), and the advective time-lag from the Labrador Sea might induce an even longer predictability horizon (up to 1.5 years).","[""Atmospheric forcing"",""Biological production"",""Calanus finmarchicus"",""Decadal variability"",""Northeastern Atlantic"",""Winter convection"",""Winter mixed layer depth"",""Zooplankton species""]",,10.1016/j.pocean.2016.07.009,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983382716,,0

We employed multivariable logistic regression to analyse data. Results Overall, 5979 participants (3.9% of 151 609) reported at least one NFI. Total number of NFIs was 6300: 1428 were caused by RTAs (22.7%), 1948 by falls (30.9%) and 2924 by other causes (46.4%). Married/common law status was associated with fewer falls, but not with RTA.

We propose a new estimation strategy based on a two-part model to decompose behavioral differences between exiting and surviving firms. Young firms contribute most to net job creation, despite high relative exit rates, due to high growth rates among young surviving firms. Small firms have similar job creation rates conditional on survival as large firms. Small firms' contribution to job creation is, however, smaller due to higher exit rates. The up-or-out dynamics characterizing less regulated economies such as the US also apply to the more regulated Austrian economy. During the Great Recession both the relative net job creation rate conditional on survival and the relative survival probability of young firms decreased.

However, monitoring the effectiveness of nonnative species control programmes is necessary to evaluate the efficacy of these measures. Genetic monitoring could provide valuable insights into temporal changes in demographic, ecological, and evolutionary processes in invasive populations being subject to control programmes. Such programmes should cause a decrease in effective population size and/or in genetic diversity of the targeted non-native species and an increase in population genetic structuring over time. We used microsatellite DNA data from American mink (Neovison vison) to determine whether the removal of this predator on the Koster Islands archipelago and the nearby Swedish mainland affected genetic variation over six consecutive years of mink culling by trappers as part of a population control programme. We found that on Koster Islands allelic richness decreased (from on average 4.53 to 3.55), genetic structuring increased, and effective population size did not change. In contrast, the mink population from the Swedish coast showed no changes in genetic diversity or structure, suggesting the stability of this population over 6 years of culling. Effective population size did not change over time but was higher on the coast than on the islands across all years.

The success of this solution depends on the ability to safely and permanently store CO2. This study demonstrates for the first time the permanent disposal of CO2 as environmentally benign carbonate minerals in basaltic rocks. We find that over 95% of the CO2 injected into the CarbFix site in Iceland was mineralized to carbonate minerals in less than 2 years. This result contrasts with the common view that the immobilization of CO2 as carbonate minerals within geologic reservoirs takes several hundreds to thousands of years.

However, knowledge of the dynamics and paleo-environmental changes in the water column of the harbor, as well as the processes of transport and deposition of sediments that led to siltation and infilling of the harbor basin, has been lacking due to the absence of high-resolution data. To fill these gaps, we have undertaken a three-dimensional study (longitudinal, transverse and vertical) of the harbor deposits by carrying out geochemical and sedimentological analyses of four stratigraphic sections of the archaeological excavation. The results show that after a phase of relative calm during the first half of the 1st c. AD, siltation of the harbor progressed exponentially up to the 5th c. AD, when dredging operations were carried out to obtain a water level sufficient for the development of maritime and harbor activities. We attribute this acceleration of siltation to a combination of climatic, anthropic and volcanic factors. Volcanic activity was responsible for a high-energy, tsunami-type event during the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 AD. From the 5th c. AD onwards, the harbor basin of Neapolis does not appear to have been functional as evidenced by its transformation into a lagoon following coastal progradation. The last stage of infilling was the development of a flood-dominated fan delta under the combined influences of climatic cooling in the Early Medieval Cool Period and agro-pastoral activities in the catchment area of the harbor. Several generations of paleo-channels, containing flash flood deposits, as well as sheet wash from sheet floods, are indicative of high environmental instability in this period.","[""Alluvial fans"",""Archaeological excavations"",""Environmental change"",""Environmental instability"",""Flash flood"",""Harbor basins"",""Neapolis"",""Sedimentological analysis""]","[""Alluvial fans"",""Ancient harbor basin"",""Flash floods"",""Geochemistry"",""Neapolis"",""Paleo-tsunami"",""Sheet floods""]",10.1016/j.quascirev.2016.08.026,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84983731367,,0

To date, most studies have relied on optical satellite data and new efforts have greatly improved our quantitative knowledge on forest dynamics. However, most of these studies yield results for only a relatively short time period or are limited to certain countries. We have quantified large-scale forest loss over a 21-year period (1990&ndash;2010) in the tropical biomes of South America using remotely sensed vegetation optical depth (VOD). This passive microwave satellite-based indicator of vegetation water content and vegetation density has a much coarser spatial resolution than optical data but its temporal resolution is higher and VOD is not impacted by aerosols and cloud cover. We used the merged VOD product of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) observations, and developed a change detection algorithm to quantify spatial and temporal variations in forest loss dynamics. Our results compared reasonably well with the newly developed Landsat-based Global Forest Change (GFC) maps, available for the 2001 onwards period (<i>r</i>2 Combining double low line g€¯0.90 when comparing annual country-level estimates). This allowed us to convert our identified changes in VOD to forest loss area and compute these from 1990 onwards. We also compared these calibrated results to PRODES (<i>r</i>2 Combining double low line g€¯0.60 when comparing annual state-level estimates). We found that South American forest exhibited substantial interannual variability without a clear trend during the 1990s, but increased from 2000 until 2004. After 2004, forest loss decreased again, except for two smaller peaks in 2007 and 2010. For a large part, these trends were driven by changes in Brazil, which was responsible for 56g€¯% of the total South American forest loss area over our study period according to our results. One of the key findings of our study is that while forest loss decreased in Brazil after 2005, increases in other countries partly offset this trend suggesting that South American forest loss as a whole decreased much less than that in Brazil.",,,10.5194/bg-13-609-2016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84957800334,https://www.biogeosciences.net/13/609/2016/bg-13-609-2016.pdf,0

Considerable attention has been paid to quantifying these industrial process emissions from cement production, but the natural reversal of the process - carbonation - has received little attention in carbon cycle studies. Here, we use new and existing data on cement materials during cement service life, demolition, and secondary use of concrete waste to estimate regional and global CO 2 uptake between 1930 and 2013 using an analytical model describing carbonation chemistry. We find that carbonation of cement materials over their life cycle represents a large and growing net sink of CO 2, increasing from 0.10 GtC yr â '1 in 1998 to 0.25 GtC yr â '1 in 2013. In total, we estimate that a cumulative amount of 4.5 GtC has been sequestered in carbonating cement materials from 1930 to 2013, offsetting 43% of the CO 2 emissions from production of cement over the same period, not including emissions associated with fossil use during cement production.

BPD patients predominantly show unresolved attachment representations. The oxytocin (OT) system is associated with human social attachment and affiliative behavior, and OT dysregulation may be related to distinct attachment characteristics. Here, we investigated whether attachment representations are related to peripheral OT levels in BPD patients. Twenty-one female BPD patients and 20 age-, gender-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) were assessed with clinical scales and measures of interpersonal and attachment-related characteristics, including the Adult Attachment Projective Picture System (AAP). Plasma OT concentrations were measured prior to and during social exclusion in a virtual ball tossing game (Cyberball). The majority of BPD patients (63.2%) but no HCs showed unresolved (disorganized) attachment representations. In this subgroup of patients, baseline OT plasma levels were significantly lower than in BPD patients with organized attachment representations. This pilot study extends previous findings of altered OT regulation in BPD as a putative key mechanism underlying interpersonal dysregulation.

The focus of this paper is the image of the shipping industry. This study reports on the findings of a large-scale survey of the image of shipping- and image-related concepts among upper secondary school pupils in Sweden, Norway and Greece. We define and analyse empirically by means of multivariate statistical analysis the anatomy of the image concept. We identify various image dimensions, estimate how young people rate the shipping industry along these dimensions and estimate their relative importance to young people who are planning their future careers. The results from this study can be used as a base for describing and explaining the images that young people have of the shipping industry. Such knowledge is fundamental for deriving and developing constructive strategies to promote careers in shipping, to adapt shipping to the expectations of young people and to develop creative and relevant educational programmes.

Here we report the first retromer-trafficking interactome in Toxoplasma gondii. This retromer complex includes a trimer Vps35-Vps26-Vps29 core complex that serves as a hub for the endosome-like compartment and parasite-specific proteins. Conditional ablation of TgVps35 reveals that the retromer complex is crucial for the biogenesis of secretory organelles and for maintaining parasite morphology. We identify TgHP12 as a parasite-specific and retromer-associated protein with functions unrelated to secretory organelle formation. Furthermore, the major facilitator superfamily homologue named TgHP03, which is a multiple spanning and ligand transmembrane transporter, is maintained at the parasite membrane by retromer-mediated endocytic recycling. Thus, our findings highlight that both evolutionarily conserved and unconventional proteins act in concert in T. gondii by controlling retrograde transport that is essential for parasite integrity and host infection.","[""Amino Acid Sequence"",""Animals"",""Cell Compartmentation"",""Cell Membrane"",""Endocytosis"",""Endosomes"",""Gene Silencing"",""Genes, Protozoan"",""Host-Parasite Interactions"",""Molecular Sequence Data"",""Multiprotein Complexes"",""Organelle Biogenesis"",""Parasites"",""Phenotype"",""Protein Interaction Mapping"",""Protozoan Proteins"",""Species Specificity"",""Toxoplasma"",""Vesicular Transport Proteins""]",,10.1038/ncomms11191,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964395577,https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11191.pdf,0

Resultados del registro Ebrictus,"© 2016 Revista de Neurología.Aim. To determine the population incidence of intracerebral haemorrhage and its preventable incidence, associated risk factors and prognosis of death and disability. Subjects and methods. We examined a sample of 240 consecutive patients with a first episode of intracerebral haemorrhage between 1st April 2006 and 30th June 2015. The main variables are: NIHSS scale, comorbidity, pharmacological information, Barthel index, Rankin scale, time within therapeutic window, prognosis and destination on hospital discharge. The ‘unnecessarily premature and sanitarily avoidable mortality’ (MIPSE) classification was applied to define the cases as ‘preventable incidence’. Results. The rate of population incidence of haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease was 23.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants/year; an exponential increase occurred from the age of 55 years in males and 75 years in females. The rate ratio was 0.682. The preventable incidence would account for 66.6% of all the cases in those under 75 years of age and 22.7% in those aged 75 or over. The chances of survival and functional autonomy were significantly lower in females, and age, anticoagulant treatment, the presence of polymedication and treatment with serotonin reuptake inhibitor antidepressants were factors that were independent of the prognosis. Conclusions. The incidence of haemorrhagic cerebrovascular disease does not appear to be modified within the period, but just the opposite occurs with the factors associated according to sex and age.

Only a few decision support methodologies and integrative methods for evaluating the ecological status of rivers are used in river restoration projects, thereby limiting informed management decisions in restoration planning as well as success control. Moreover, studies quantifying river restoration effects are often based on the assessment of a single organism group, and the effects on terrestrial communities are often neglected. In addition, potential effects of water quality or hydrological degradation are often not considered for the evaluation of restoration projects. We used multi-attribute value theory to re-formulate an existing river assessment protocol and extend it to a more comprehensive, integrated ecological assessment program. We considered habitat conditions, water quality regarding nutrients, micropollutants and heavy metals, and five instream and terrestrial organism groups (fish, benthic invertebrates, aquatic vegetation, ground beetles and riparian vegetation). The physical, chemical and biological states of the rivers were assessed separately and combined to value the overall ecological state. The assessment procedure was then applied to restored and unrestored sites at two Swiss rivers to test its feasibility in quantifying the effect of river restoration. Uncertainty in observations was taken into account and propagated through the assessment framework to evaluate the significance of differences between the ecological states of restored and unrestored reaches. In the restored sites, we measured a higher width variability of the river, as well as a higher width of the riparian zone and a higher richness of organism groups. According to the ecological assessment, the river morphology and the biological states were significantly better at the restored sites, with the largest differences detected for ground beetles and fish communities, followed by benthic invertebrates and riparian vegetation. The state of the aquatic vegetation was slightly lower at the restored sites. According to our assessment, the presence of invasive plant species counteracted the potential ecological gain. Water quality could be a causal factor contributing to the absence of larger improvements. Overall, we found significantly better biological and physical states, and integrated ecological states at the restored sites. Even in the absence of comprehensive before-after data, based on the similarity of the reaches before restoration and mechanistic biological knowledge, this can be safely interpreted as a causal consequence of restoration. An integrative perspective across aquatic and riparian organism groups was important to assess the biological effects, because organism groups responded differently to restoration. In addition, the potential deteriorating effect of water quality demonstrates the importance of integrated planning for the reduction of morphological, water quality and hydrological degradation.","[""Aquatic macroinvertebrates"",""Aquatic vegetation"",""Ecological state"",""Ground beetles"",""Multi-attribute value theories"",""Multi-criteria decision analysis"",""Riparian vegetation"",""River restoration"",""Uncertainty""]","[""Aquatic macroinvertebrates"",""Aquatic vegetation"",""Ecological state"",""Fish"",""Ground beetles"",""Multi-attribute value theory"",""Multi-criteria decision analysis"",""Riparian vegetation"",""River restoration"",""Thur and Töss rivers"",""Uncertainty""]",10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.07.048,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84982102643,https://www.dora.lib4ri.ch/eawag/islandora/object/eawag%3A10643/datastream/PDF2/Paillex-2017-Integrating_and_extending_ecological_river_assessment-%28accepted_version%29.pdf,0

Both species are listed as Data Deficient by the IUCN, mainly due to the lack of information about population sizes and trends. The goal of this study was to build spatially explicit models for the abundance of both species in relation to environmental variables using data collected during eight scientific cruises along the Patagonian shelf. Spatial models were constructed using generalized additive models. In total, 88 schools (212 individuals) of Commerson's dolphin and 134 schools (465 individuals) of Peale's dolphin were recorded in 8,535 km surveyed. Commerson's dolphin was found less than 60 km from shore; whereas Peale's dolphins occurred over a wider range of distances from the coast, the number of animals sighted usually being larger near or far from the coast. Fitted models indicate overall abundances of approximately 22,000 Commerson's dolphins and 20,000 Peale's dolphins in the total area studied. This work provides the first large-scale abundance estimate for Peale's dolphin in the Atlantic Ocean and an update of population size for Commerson's dolphin.

Some even argue that 2 °C is no longer feasible or might have unacceptable social and environmental costs. Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement endorsed an aspirational goal of limiting global warming to even lower levels, arguing that climate impacts - especially for vulnerable nations such as small island states - will be unacceptably severe in a 2 °C world. While there are few pathways to 2 °C that do not rely on negative emissions, 1.5 °C scenarios are barely conceivable without them.

All rights reserved.IMPORTANCE: Cancer is the second leading cause of death worldwide. Current estimates on the burden of cancer are needed for cancer control planning. OBJECTIVE: To estimate mortality, incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 32 cancers in 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2015. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Cancer mortality was estimated using vital registration system data, cancer registry incidence data (transformed to mortality estimates using separately estimated mortality to incidence [MI] ratios), and verbal autopsy data. Cancer incidence was calculated by dividing mortality estimates through the modeled MI ratios. To calculate cancer prevalence, MI ratios were used to model survival. To calculate YLDs, prevalence estimates were multiplied by disability weights. The YLLs were estimated by multiplying age-specific cancer deaths by the reference life expectancy. DALYs were estimated as the sum of YLDs and YLLs. A sociodemographic index (SDI) was created for each location based on income per capita, educational attainment, and fertility. Countries were categorized by SDI quintiles to summarize results. FINDINGS: In 2015, there were 17.5 million cancer cases worldwide and 8.7 million deaths. Between 2005 and 2015, cancer cases increased by 33%, with population aging contributing 16%, population growth 13%, and changes in age-specific rates contributing 4%. For men, the most common cancer globally was prostate cancer (1.6 million cases). Tracheal, bronchus, and lung cancer was the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs in men (1.2 million deaths and 25.9 million DALYs). For women, the most common cancer was breast cancer (2.4 million cases). Breast cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths and DALYs for women (523 000 deaths and 15.1 million DALYs). Overall, cancer caused 208.3 million DALYs worldwide in 2015 for both sexes combined. Between 2005 and 2015, age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers combined increased in 174 of 195 countries or territories. Age-standardized death rates (ASDRs) for all cancers combined decreased within that timeframe in 140 of 195 countries or territories. Countries with an increase in the ASDR due to all cancers were largely located on the African continent. Of all cancers, deaths between 2005 and 2015 decreased significantly for Hodgkin lymphoma (-6.1% [95% uncertainty interval (UI), -10.6% to -1.3%]). The number of deaths also decreased for esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, and chronic myeloid leukemia, although these results were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: As part of the epidemiological transition, cancer incidence is expected to increase in the future, further straining limited health care resources. Appropriate allocation of resources for cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and curative and palliative care requires detailed knowledge of the local burden of cancer. The GBD 2015 study results demonstrate that progress is possible in the war against cancer. However, the major findings also highlight an unmet need for cancer prevention efforts, including tobacco control, vaccination, and the promotion of physical activity and a healthy diet.","[""Age Distribution"",""Female"",""Global Burden of Disease"",""Humans"",""Incidence"",""Male"",""Neoplasms"",""Sex Distribution"",""Time Factors""]",,10.1001/jamaoncol.2016.5688,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85018321414,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/102288/1/csc160002.pdf,0

Our model, which we name MOZLEAP, is calibrated on the basis of recently developed local energy statistics, demographic and urbanization trends as well as cross-country based GDP elasticities for biomass consumption, sector structure, vehicle ownership and energy intensity. We develop four scenarios to evaluate the impact of the anticipated surge in natural resources exploration on aggregate trends in energy supply and demand, the energy infrastructure and economic growth in Mozambique. Our analysis shows that until 2030, primary energy production is likely to increase at least six-fold, and probably much more. This is roughly 10 times the expected increase in energy demand; most of the increase in energy production is destined for export. As a result, Mozambique may well become one of the leading global producers of natural gas and coal. We discuss the opportunities and challenges that this resource wealth poses for the country.","[""Energy model"",""Energy sector"",""LEAP"",""Mozambique"",""Scenarios""]","[""Energy Modeling"",""Energy Sector"",""LEAP"",""Mozambique"",""Scenarios""]",10.1016/j.eneco.2016.08.010,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85008675409,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2016.08.010,0

And we show how un-sustainable scenarios can be understood in terms of insufficient balancing feed-back in the system. We apply the methodology to picture such imbalances as fundamental drivers behind the tragedy of the commons. And we apply it to go deeper into a specific business example in this context, a complex case of resource exploitation in Far East Asia. The CLD analyses inform a discussion on the interplay between societies on the one hand, represented by the Government and its legislature, and the private sector with its companies, consumers and market on the other. Our study confirms that unsustainability can only be understood and addressed at the systemic level, encompassing both natural and social systems, where also the virtual and emergent systems of modern civilization are considered. The results show that a market economy can only be sustainable as well as really free, when embedded in a systemic and balanced interplay between the actors on the arena. The provision of the market arena with well thought-through rules of the game, offered by a well-functioning democratic society, is needed. The challenge for leaders in business and society is to be able to grasp the causalities of the whole system, and let this guide and shape sustainable goals as well as leadership and management in coherence with such goals.","[""Business and societies"",""Causal loop diagrams"",""Free market"",""Leadership"",""Market failures"",""Modern civilization"",""Public and private sector"",""Tragedy of the commons""]","[""Free market"",""Leadership"",""Market failures"",""Sustainability"",""Systems analysis"",""Tragedy of the commons""]",10.1016/j.jclepro.2015.06.087,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84941005346,,0

Due to their efficiency and cost-effectiveness, water quality models have been increasingly applied to catchments as Decision Support Tools (DSTs) to identify mitigation options that can be introduced to reduce agricultural diffuse water pollution and improve water quality. In this study, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the River Wensum catchment in eastern England with the aim of quantifying the long-term impacts of potential changes to agricultural management practices on river water quality. Calibration and validation were successfully performed at a daily time-step against observations of discharge, nitrate and total phosphorus obtained from high-frequency water quality monitoring within the Blackwater sub-catchment, covering an area of 19.6 km2. A variety of mitigation options were identified and modelled, both singly and in combination, and their long-term effects on nitrate and total phosphorus losses were quantified together with the 95% uncertainty range of model predictions. Results showed that introducing a red clover cover crop to the crop rotation scheme applied within the catchment reduced nitrate losses by 19.6%. Buffer strips of 2 m and 6 m width represented the most effective options to reduce total phosphorus losses, achieving reductions of 12.2% and 16.9%, respectively. This is one of the first studies to quantify the impacts of agricultural mitigation options on long-term water quality for nitrate and total phosphorus at a daily resolution, in addition to providing an estimate of the uncertainties of those impacts. The results highlighted the need to consider multiple pollutants, the degree of uncertainty associated with model predictions and the risk of unintended pollutant impacts when evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation options, and showed that high-frequency water quality datasets can be applied to robustly calibrate water quality models, creating DSTs that are more effective and reliable.","[""Agriculture"",""England"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Geography"",""Humans"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Nitrates"",""Phosphorus"",""Rivers"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical"",""Water Pollution"",""Water Quality""]","[""Catchment management"",""Catchment modelling"",""Diffuse water pollution"",""Mitigation scenarios"",""SWAT"",""Water quality""]",10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.05.002,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84968901932,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2016.05.002,0

Main objective of this work is to exploit massive MIMO technology to reduce Hybrid Automatic Repeat Query (HARQ) retransmission delay. Massive MIMO indoor environment is created by a 3D ray-tracing tool to simulate the received power, phase, delay, and angle of arrival of each ray in the channel. Two sizes of rectangular antenna array are used to evaluate the performance of beamforming in enhancing the bit error rate. This reflects directly on the mean and maximum numbers of packet retransmission. The angle between user-equipments is considered to evaluate the effect of inter-user interference on HARQ.

In this six-wave longitudinal study we sought to examine the interplay among maternal empathy, multiple indicators of mother-adolescent relationship quality (i.e., balanced relatedness, conflict, and support), and adolescent antisocial behaviors rated both by adolescents and their mothers. Participants for the current study were 497 Dutch adolescents (56.9% males) followed from age 13 to 18, and their mothers. A series of cross-lagged panel models revealed reciprocal associations between maternal empathy and mother-adolescent relationship quality and between mother-adolescent relationship quality and adolescent antisocial behaviors. Interestingly, we also found some indirect effects of adolescent antisocial behaviors on maternal empathy mediated by mother-adolescent relationship quality. Overall, this study further highlights a process of reciprocal influences within mother-adolescent dyads.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Antisocial Personality Disorder"",""Empathy"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Middle Aged"",""Parent-Child Relations""]",,10.1371/journal.pone.0150009,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84962191246,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0150009&type=printable,0

Both scooters are 4-stroke, 125 cm3 of engine capacity and Euro 3 compliant. They were tested on chassis dynamometer for measuring gaseous emissions of CO, HC, NOx, CO2 and some toxic micro organic pollutants, such as benzene, 1,3-butadiene, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The fuel consumption was estimated throughout a carbon balance on the exhaust species. Moreover, total particles number with diameter between 20 nm up to 1 μm was measured. Worldwide and European test cycles were carried out with both scooters fuelled with gasoline and ethanol/gasoline blends (10/90, 20/80 and 30/70% vol). According to the experimental results relative to both scooter technologies, the addiction of ethanol in gasoline reduces CO and particles number emissions. The combustion of conventional scooter becomes unstable when a percentage of 30%v of bioethanol is fed; as consequence a strong increasing of hydrocarbon is monitored, including carcinogenic species. The negative effects of ethanol fuel are related to the increasing of fuel consumption due to the less carbon content for volume unit and to the increasing of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde due to the higher oxygen availability.

A realistic 800MW scenario and a high-impact scenario with massive expansion of tidal energy extraction to 8GW scenario were considered. The realistic 800MW scenario suggested minor effects on the tides, and undetectable effects on the biogeochemistry. The massive-expansion 8GW scenario suggested effects would be observed over hundreds of kilometres away with changes of up to 10% in tidal and ecosystem variables, in particular in a broad area in the vicinity of the Wash. There, waters became less turbid, and primary production increased with associated increases in faunal ecosystem variables. Moreover, a one-off increase in carbon storage in the sea bed was detected.

We report the 12-month (midpoint) effects of a 2-year multicomponent physical activity intervention implemented in disadvantaged secondary schools. Methods: A cluster randomised trial was undertaken in 10 secondary schools located in disadvantaged areas in New South Wales, Australia. Students in Grade 7 were recruited, with follow-up in Grade 8. The intervention was guided by socioecological theory and included seven physical activity strategies, and six implementation adoption strategies. The primary outcome was mean minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day assessed using Actigraph GT3X accelerometers. Outcome data were analysed using repeated measures linear mixed models. Results: At baseline, 1150 (93%) students participated in the data collection (mean age 12 years, 48% boys) and 1050 (79%) students participated at 12-month follow-up. By the 12-month follow-up, the six implementation adoption strategies had been used to support schools to deliver four of the seven physical activity elements. There was a significant group-by-time interaction for mean minutes of MVPA per day in favour of the intervention group (adjusted difference between groups at follow-up=3.85 min, 95% CI (0.79 to 6.91), p≤0.01), including significantly more vigorous physical activity (2.45 min, p≤0.01), equating to 27 min more MVPA per week.

Perhaps, most critical among the exogenous forces operating on MNEs are those exerted by state and other key institutional actors in host countries. Crucially, academic research conducted to date offers little data about how MNEs use their CSR activities to strategically manage their relationship with those actors in order to gain legitimisation advantages in host countries. This paper addresses that gap by exploring interactions between external institutional pressures and firm-level CSR activities, which take the form of community initiatives, to examine how MNEs develop their legitimacy-seeking policies and practices. In focusing on a developing country, Sri Lanka, this paper provides valuable insights into how MNEs instrumentally utilise community initiatives in a country where relationship-building with governmental and other powerful non-governmental actors can be vitally important for the long-term viability of the business. Drawing on neo-institutional theory and CSR literature, this paper examines and contributes to the embryonic but emerging debate about the instrumental and political implications of CSR. The evidence presented and discussed here reveals the extent to which, and the reasons why, MNEs engage in complex legitimacy-seeking relationships with Sri Lankan host institutions.",,"[""Community initiatives"",""Corporate social responsibility"",""Developing country"",""Government"",""Legitimacy"",""Multinational enterprises"",""Political behaviour""]",10.1007/s10551-014-2478-z,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84920520458,http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/id/eprint/22381/1/BeddewelaSEeking.pdf,0

Age estimates for this stock have customarily been obtained by counting annuli on the surface of whole otoliths but a matched pair comparison indicated that ages estimated from whole and thin-sectioned otoliths were the same up until age 9 (~60 cm), after which whole otoliths underestimated the true age of the fish by up to 60% and 18 years. Bomb radiocarbon analyses on otolith cores from thin sections were similar to expectations based on the Greenland Halibut reference chronology, indicating that on average, thin sections gave an accurate age for fish in the 57-108 cm TL range. Growth curves estimated using thin-sectioned otoliths indicated that Greenland Halibut in this region are slower growing and longer lived than was previously thought. A comparison of growth parameters with other populations of Greenland Halibut showed that although the Pacific and Arctic are faster-growing, the stock off the East Coast of Canada is longer lived. This study represents the first age validation study for this stock in the Northwest Atlantic. Since the fishable portion of the population is largely <60 cm, it is possible that these results may not change the current perception of stock status. However, the increased longevity and reduced growth rates will undoubtedly affect other biological parameters and further work should be done to incorporate the new ageing knowledge into the Management Strategy Evaluation for this stock.",,"[""Age validation"",""Bomb radiocarbon dating"",""Greenland Halibut"",""Northwest Atlantic"",""Stock assessment""]",10.1016/j.fishres.2016.01.016,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958279707,,0

We therefore performed an IPD meta-analysis on the association between standardized serum 25(OH)D and mortality. Methods In a European consortium of eight prospective studies, including seven general population cohorts, we used the Vitamin D Standardization Program (VDSP) protocols to standardize 25(OH)D data. Meta-analyses using a one step procedure on IPD were performed to study associations of 25(OH)D with all-cause mortality as the primary outcome, and with cardiovascular and cancer mortality as secondary outcomes. This meta-analysis is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02438488. Findings We analysed 26916 study participants (median age 61.6 years, 58% females) with a median 25(OH)D concentration of 53.8 nmol/L. During a median follow-up time of 10.5 years, 6802 persons died. Compared to participants with 25(OH)D concentrations of 75 to 99.99 nmol/L, the adjusted hazard ratios (with 95% confidence interval) for mortality in the 25(OH)D groups with 40 to 49.99, 30 to 39.99, and <30 nmol/L were 1.15 (1.00-1.29), 1.33 (1.16-1.51), and 1.67 (1.44-1.89), respectively. We observed similar results for cardiovascular mortality, but there was no significant linear association between 25(OH)D and cancer mortality. There was also no significantly increased mortality risk at high 25(OH)D levels up to 125 nmol/L. Interpretation In the first IPD meta-analysis using standardized measurements of 25(OH)D we observed an association between low 25(OH)D and increased risk of all-cause mortality.

Recently, The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) proposed a consensus definition of malnutrition. The aim of the present study was to describe the prevalence of malnutrition according to the ESPEN definition in four diverse populations. Methods: In total, 349 acutely ill middle-aged patients, 135 geriatric outpatients, 306 healthy old individuals and 179 healthy young individuals were included in the study. Subjects were screened for risk of malnutrition using the SNAQ. The ESPEN definition of malnutrition, i.e. low BMI (< 18.5 kg/m2) or a combination of unintentional weight loss and low FFMI or low BMI was applied to all subjects. Results: Screening identified 0, 0.5, 10 and 30% of the healthy young, the healthy old, the geriatric outpatients and the acutely ill middle-aged patients as being at risk of malnutrition. The prevalence of malnutrition ranged from 0% in the healthy young, 0.5% in healthy old individuals, 6% in the geriatric outpatients to 14% in the acutely ill middle-aged patients. Prevalence of low FFMI was observed in all four populations (14-33%), but concurred less frequently with weight loss (0-13%). Conclusions: Using the ESPEN definition, 0%-14% malnutrition was found in the diverse populations. Further work is needed to fully address the validity of a two-step approach, including risk assessment as an initial step in screening and defining malnutrition. Furthermore, assessing the predictive validity of the ESPEN definition is needed.","[""Acute Disease"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Body Composition"",""Body Mass Index"",""Consensus"",""Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena"",""Europe"",""Female"",""Geriatric Assessment"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Malnutrition"",""Middle Aged"",""Nutrition Assessment"",""Nutritional Sciences"",""Nutritional Status"",""Practice Guidelines as Topic"",""Prevalence"",""Risk"",""Risk Assessment"",""Societies, Scientific"",""Thinness"",""Young Adult""]","[""Body mass index"",""Definition"",""Fat free mass index"",""Malnutrition"",""Prevalence""]",10.1016/j.clnu.2015.06.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84934324039,https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/617227/1/prevalence%20of%20malnutrition%20according%20to%20ESPEN.pdf,0

It has also been showed that behavioral misuse complicates substance abuse treatment, and that clients with such co-occurring difficulties have considerable treatment needs. Methodology: This study is based on interviews with six clients in substance abuse treatment, who also had a history of behavioral misuse. The interviews concerned the participants’ perception of their behavioral misuse and of themselves, and were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis. Findings and clinical implications: The participants perceived behavioral misuse as an escape from self-criticism and experiences of non-coherence. They also perceived relations and affects as overwhelming. Through behavioral misuse, relational and affective needs, as well as distressing self-experiences, were mitigated.

As climate mitigation is not the focal goal of consumers who are buying or consuming food, the study highlighted the role of motivational and cognitive background factors, including possible spillover effects. Consumer samples in the Netherlands (n = 527) and the United States (n = 556) were asked to evaluate food-related and energy-related mitigation options in a design that included three food-related options with very different mitigation potentials (i.e. eating less meat, buying local and seasonal food, and buying organic food). They rated each option's effectiveness and their willingness to adopt it. The outstanding effectiveness of the less meat option (as established by climate experts) was recognized by merely 12% of the Dutch and 6% of the American sample. Many more participants gave fairly positive effectiveness ratings and this was correlated with belief in human causation of climate change, personal importance of climate change, and being a moderate meat eater. Willingness to adopt the less meat option increased with its perceived effectiveness and, controlling for that, it was significantly related to various motivationally relevant factors. The local food option appealed to consumer segments with overlapping but partly different motivational orientations. It was concluded that a transition to a low carbon society can significantly benefit from a special focus on the food-related options to involve more consumers and to improve mitigation.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Aged"",""Carbon"",""Choice Behavior"",""Climate Change"",""Consumer Behavior"",""Cross-Sectional Studies"",""Diet"",""Educational Status"",""Feeding Behavior"",""Female"",""Food Preferences"",""Food, Organic"",""Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice"",""Humans"",""Life Style"",""Male"",""Meat"",""Middle Aged"",""Netherlands"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""United States"",""Young Adult""]","[""Climate change"",""Consumers"",""Local and seasonal food"",""Meat eating"",""Mitigation""]",10.1016/j.appet.2015.12.001,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84951868193,https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/1309510/Postprint%20Appetite2016.pdf,0

Hence, creating parks and other types of natural reserves is an issue that demands desperate action in order to ensure the environmental health of the planet. Human activities in relation to natural resources and bio-chemical cycles disturb the sustainability of the earth’s surface. Due to these effects, it is necessary to improve policies in protected areas to deal with the deterioration caused by human activities and bio-chemical cycles. The rationale behind the development of relevant policies is to cater to the need to understand each protected area as a being a part of local development systems. Other policies that have been developed include defining local action and internal management systems such as tourism activities. Local policies related to tourism management and getting local people involved in protected areas’ management are two important approaches that need to be evaluated in order to identify future challenges in regards to the conservation of protected areas. This chapter analyzes Costa Rica as a case study for tropical experiences, taking into consideration events of the last 40 years that have established an important number of protected areas covering about 15% of the country’s terrestrial surface and the policies that have been implemented for their protection. It evaluates the issue of tourism management and involvement of local people in protected areas as a master plan. Finally, some recommendations are given to reduce the negative effects of tourism in these areas.

Physically degraded soil is of particular interest because small RFs might be considered a factor in its remediation. In our laboratory experiment we mixed five different proportions of 4–8-mm sized RFs with a Luvisol and a Regosol that have poor ability to self-structure and were characterized by a massive structure in the field. Nine wetting and drying cycles were applied to repacked samples (15 cm in diameter and height) of soil–RF mixtures to facilitate the formation of soil structure. Image analysis was used to quantify development of the pore system at varying RF contents. The physically degraded soils studied in this research initially showed a decrease and then an increase in porosity with increasing amounts of RFs in the soil–RF mixtures. The results indicated that the Regosol responded more than the Luvisol to RF content. Threshold values of RF content at which the mechanism of pore formation prevails over that of pore reduction depended upon the soil type and can be attributed reasonably to small differences in the coefficient of linear extensibility (COLE). We also identified a mechanism for the propagation of porosity downwards from the soil surface with increasing RF content, together with a vertical homogenization effect on porosity. Our results contribute to understanding the mechanisms by which small rock fragments embedded in physically degraded topsoil induce changes in the pore system and confirm the potential of rock fragments to protect soil structure in soil susceptible to compaction. Highlights: Physical interaction between rock fragments and fine earth in degraded soil. Soil porosity examined by combined experimental laboratory approach with image analysis. Soil porosity first decreases then increases with increasing content of rock fragments.

However, alternative approaches are required for ERA of ENPs because of the huge gap in data and knowledge compared to conventional pollutants and their unique properties that make it difficult to apply existing approaches. This study aims to propose an ERA approach for ENPs by integrating Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy inference models which provide a systematic evaluation of risk factors and reducing uncertainty about the data and information, respectively. Risk is assumed to be the combination of occurrence likelihood, exposure potential and toxic effects in the environment. A hierarchy was established to evaluate the sub factors of these components. Evaluation was made with fuzzy numbers to reduce uncertainty and incorporate the expert judgements. Overall score of each component was combined with fuzzy inference rules by using expert judgements. Proposed approach reports the risk class and its membership degree such as Minor (0.7). Therefore, results are precise and helpful to determine the risk management strategies. Moreover, priority weights calculated by comparing the risk factors based on their importance for the risk enable users to understand which factor is effective on the risk. Proposed approach was applied for Ag (two nanoparticles with different coating) and TiO2 nanoparticles for different case studies. Results verified the proposed benefits of the approach.","[""Analytical Hierarchy Process"",""Engineered nanomaterials"",""Engineered nanoparticles"",""Environmental risk assessment"",""Fuzzy inference model"",""Fuzzy inference rules"",""Fuzzy numbers"",""Risk management strategies"",""Environmental Monitoring"",""Environmental Pollutants"",""Fuzzy Logic"",""Models, Theoretical"",""Nanostructures"",""Risk Assessment"",""Risk Management""]","[""Fuzzy numbers"",""Nanoparticles"",""Risk assessment"",""Silver"",""Titanium dioxide""]",10.1016/j.envint.2016.04.022,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964545022,,0

Methods: The study included 411 patients treated with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection for prostate cancer with lymph node metastases at 10 tertiary care centers between 1995 and 2014. Kaplan–Meier analyses were used to assess cancer-specific mortality-free survival rates at 8 years' follow up in the overall population, and after stratifying patients according to clinical and pathological parameters. Uni- and multivariable competing risk Cox regression analyses were used to assess cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality. Finally, cumulative-incidence plots were generated for cancer-specific mortality and other-cause mortality after stratifying patients according to the number of positive lymph nodes and the median age at surgery, according to the competing risks method. Results: Men with prostate-specific antigen ≤40 ng/mL and those with one to three positive lymph nodes showed higher cancer-specific mortality-free survival estimates as compared with their counterparts with prostate-specific antigen >40 ng/mL and >3 metastatic lymph nodes, respectively (all P < 0.001). At multivariable Cox regression analyses, preoperative prostate-specific antigen >40 ng/mL, >3 lymph node metastases and pathological Gleason score 8–10 were all independent predictors of cancer-specific mortality (all P-values ≤0.001). On competing risk analysis, when patients were stratified according to the number of positive lymph nodes (namely, ≤3 vs >3), the 8-year cancer-specific mortality rates were 27.4% versus 44.8% for patients aged <65 years, and 15.2% versus 52.6% for patients aged ≥65 years, respectively. Conclusions: Three positive lymph nodes represent the best prognostic cut-off in node-positive prostate cancer patients.

However, only few restoration projects have been rigorously evaluated so far. We investigated the response of fish assemblages to hydromorphological restoration measures including river widening, creation of instream structures, flow enhancement, remeandering and side-channel reconnection. We sampled 15 rivers with pairs of degraded and restored sites and calculated the effect sizes (i.e., restored–degraded) for species richness, species diversity, fish density and habitat traits. We analysed the following factors potentially affecting restoration success: (1) length of the restored river stretch, (2) time after restoration and (3) hydromorphological quality of restoration. While species diversity and density did not respond to restoration, proportion of small rheophilic fish increased and eurytopic decreased. Short-term (<3 years) and long-term effects (>12 years) of restoration measures have a stronger effect on fish assemblages than mid-term effects. Furthermore, the hydromorphological quality and the length of the restored section are relevant for the restoration effects on the fish community. Future restoration projects should focus on more dynamic, self-sustaining habitat improvements extending over several kilometres and should be coupled with other measures such as restoring the river continuity and species reintroductions.",,"[""Effect size"",""Hydromorphological quality"",""Restoration monitoring"",""Restoration success"",""Restored section length"",""Rheophilic fish""]",10.1007/s10750-015-2354-6,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959567349,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10750-015-2354-6.pdf,0

Subfossil beetle remains from archaeological sites have proven invaluable for examining past living conditions, human activities, and their impacts on landscapes and ecosystems. 2. In Iceland, specific economic practices (e.g. land management and natural resource exploitation) and major historical events (i.e. colonisation, economic intensification and commercialisation, and urbanisation) have affected local environments and left recognisable traces in the beetle subfossil record. 3. Understanding the ecology of synanthropic beetles is crucial if they are to be employed in high-resolution reconstructions of past lifeways and their ecological impacts, yet, because buildings' interiors are rarely the object of systematic entomological research, the ecological requirements of many such species are poorly understood. 4. A survey was conducted of live and dead beetle faunas from habitats that have so far been largely neglected by entomological research: stable manure and stored hay inside farm buildings, two key facets of a northern European pastoral economy. 5. The present results clarify the ecological requirements of some under-studied synanthropic beetles and the processes by which their exoskeletons may become incorporated into the archaeological record while also producing new records of exotic species recently introduced to Iceland. 6.

Utilizing Phaseolus vulgaris L. as a model system, this study demonstrates the occurrence and sensitivity of carbon isotope fractionation during the onset of abiotic stresses between leaf and phloem carbon pools. In addition to gas exchange data, compound-specific measures of carbon isotope abundance and concentrations of soluble components of phloem sap were compared with major carbohydrate and sugar alcohol pools in leaf tissue. Differences in both d13C and concentration of metabolites were found in leaf and phloem tissues, the magnitude of which responded to changing environmental conditions. These changes have inplications for the modeling of leaf-level gas exchange based upon d13C natural abundance. Estimates of d13C of low molecular weight carbohydrates and polyols increased the precision of predictions of water use efficiency compared with those based on bulk soluble carbon. The use of this technique requires consideration of the dynamics of the d13C pool under investigation. Understanding the dynamics of changes in d13C during movement and incorporation into heterotrophic tissues is vital for the continued development of tools that provide information on plant physiological performance relating to water use.","[""Carbohydrate Metabolism"",""Carbohydrates"",""Carbon"",""Carbon Isotopes"",""Environment"",""Phaseolus"",""Phloem"",""Photosynthesis"",""Plant Leaves"",""Polymers"",""Water""]","[""Carbon"",""Growth"",""Isotopes"",""Natural abundance"",""Water"",""Yield""]",10.1093/pcp/pcw099,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84988914406,https://academic.oup.com/pcp/article-pdf/57/8/1756/8731869/pcw099.pdf,0

The aim of this study is to analyse the incidence of catastrophic health expenditures and to measure the rate of impoverishment from health care payments under the social health insurance scheme in Mongolia. Methods: We used the data from the Household Socio-Economic Survey 2012, conducted by the National Statistical Office of Mongolia. Catastrophic health expenditures are defined an excess of out-of-pocket payments for health care at the various thresholds for household total expenditure (capacity to pay). For an estimate of the impoverishment effect, the national and The Wold Bank poverty lines are used. Results: About 5.5 % of total households suffered from catastrophic health expenditures, when the threshold is 10 % of the total household expenditure. At the threshold of 40 % of capacity to pay, 1.1 % of the total household incurred catastrophic health expenditures. About 20,000 people were forced into poverty due to paying for health care. Conclusions: Despite the high coverage of social health insurance, a significant proportion of the population incurred catastrophic health expenditures and was forced into poverty due to out-of-pocket payments for health care.","[""Delivery of Health Care"",""Family Characteristics"",""Female"",""Financing, Personal"",""Health Expenditures"",""Humans"",""Insurance, Health"",""Male"",""Mongolia"",""Poverty"",""Surveys and Questionnaires""]","[""Catastrophic health expenditure"",""Financial protection"",""Impoverishment"",""Mongolia""]",10.1186/s12939-016-0395-8,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84979681473,https://equityhealthj.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12939-016-0395-8,0

Cancer-specific active immunotherapy is an experimental form of treatment that stimulates the immune system to recognize antigens on the surface of cancer cells. Current experimental approaches in immunotherapy include vaccines, biochemotherapy, and the transfer of adoptive T cells and dendritic cells. Several types of vaccines, including peptide, viral, and dendritic cell vaccines, are currently under investigation for the treatment of melanoma. These treatments have the same goal as drugs that are already used to stimulate the proliferation of T lymphocytes in order to destroy tumor cells; however, immunotherapies aim to selectively attack the tumor cells of each patient. In this comprehensive review, we describe recent advancements in the development of immunotherapies for melanoma, with a specific focus on the identification of neoantigens for the prediction of their elicited immune responses. This review is expected to provide important insights into the future of immunotherapy for melanoma.","[""Cancer Vaccines"",""Dendritic Cells"",""Humans"",""Immunotherapy"",""Melanoma"",""T-Lymphocytes""]",,10.1155/2017/3264217,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85034593273,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/mi/2017/3264217.pdf,0

We aimed to examine the association between living situation and long-term mortality in patients with ischemic stroke and a control group, and to explore whether this association is modified by patient gender. Methods: This is a prospective case-control study of 600 patients with ischemic stroke before 70 years of age and 600 age-and sex-matched controls who have been included in the Sahlgrenska Study on Ischemic Stroke. Mortality data were collected through national registers and medical records. We used Cox regression models for identifying predictors of mortality. Results: In the entire sample, mean age was 57 years, proportion of males 64 %, proportion living alone 28 %, and median follow-up 8.6 years. Mortality rates were 36 % among patients living alone, 17 % among cohabitant patients, 15 % among controls living alone, and 9 % among cohabitant controls. Living alone was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in cases after adjustment for stroke severity, stroke subtype, and vascular risk factors including physical activity, alcohol consumption, and socioeconomic status. A significant interaction was found between gender and living situation; the adjusted hazard ratio for mortality was 3.47 (95 % Confidence Interval 2.13-5.65) in male patients living alone, whereas no significant association was observed in women. Living alone was also a predictor of vascular mortality among cases and of all-cause mortality among controls. Conclusions: Living alone is associated with increased long-term mortality after ischemic stroke in men. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm the observed gender difference and to identify modifiable factors underlying this increased risk.","[""Aged"",""Case-Control Studies"",""Family Characteristics"",""Female"",""Follow-Up Studies"",""Humans"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Prognosis"",""Proportional Hazards Models"",""Prospective Studies"",""Risk Factors"",""Sex Factors"",""Stroke""]","[""Cerebral infarction"",""Follow-up studies"",""Mortality"",""Prognosis"",""Socioeconomic factors"",""Stroke subtypes""]",10.1186/s12883-016-0599-y,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978208766,https://bmcneurol.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12883-016-0599-y,0

In selected patients, surgery can be technically feasible, although it is widely believed to be hazardous. As data regarding the outcome of this approach is sparse, we evaluated our institutional experience with salvage surgery. Materials and methods: Patients with a pulmonary resection for in-field locoregional recurrence or persistent tumor after high dose chemoradiotherapy (≥60 Gy) for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, were identified and retrospectively analyzed. Results: A total of 15 patients treated between January 2007 and August 2015 were eligible for evaluation. In 13 patients (87%), the indication for surgery was a locoregional recurrence, while 2 patients had persistent tumor. The prior median radiotherapy dose was 66 Gy (range 60-70). All patients underwent an anatomical resection, with 8 patients having a pneumonectomy, and all pathological specimens revealed the presence of viable tumor. The in-hospital morbidity rate was 40% (6 patients), and the 90-day mortality rate was 6.7% (1 patient). Median follow-up was 12.1 months. The estimated median overall and event-free survivals were 46 months and 43.6 months, respectively. Conclusion: Salvage surgery for locoregional recurrence or persistent tumor after high dose chemoradiotherapy, resulted in acceptable morbidity, mortality and promising outcome. It should be considered as a treatment option for selected patients.","[""Adult"",""Aged"",""Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung"",""Chemoradiotherapy"",""Combined Modality Therapy"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Kaplan-Meier Estimate"",""Lung Neoplasms"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Neoplasm Recurrence, Local"",""Neoplasm Staging"",""Salvage Therapy"",""Treatment Outcome""]","[""Chemoradiotherapy"",""Locoregional recurrence"",""Non-small cell lung cancer"",""Salvage surgery"",""Survival""]",10.1016/j.lungcan.2016.02.005,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960405720,,0

However, the potential contributions of these loci remain to be validated. In this study, we tested 17 of the most significantly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from these GWAS studies (P < 10−6 in the original studies) in a new independent population dataset from the Netherlands: known as Familial Influences on Literacy Abilities. This dataset comprised 483 children from 307 nuclear families and 505 adults (including parents of participating children), and provided adequate statistical power to detect the effects that were previously reported. The following measures of reading and language performance were collected: word reading fluency, nonword reading fluency, phonological awareness and rapid automatized naming. Two SNPs (rs12636438 and rs7187223) were associated with performance in multivariate and univariate testing, but these did not remain significant after correction for multiple testing. Another SNP (rs482700) was only nominally associated in the multivariate test. For the rest of the SNPs, we did not find supportive evidence of association. The findings may reflect differences between our study and the previous investigations with respect to the language of testing, the exact tests used and the recruitment criteria. Alternatively, most of the prior reported associations may have been false positives.

Two recent reforms of the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy introduced stakeholder participation via so-called Advisory Councils (ACs). This involved establishing a system for stakeholder representation in these organisations. This paper shows how democratic ideals that emphasise including stakeholders in environmental governance such as fisheries become constrained–or even reversed–by the realities of stakeholder representation procedures. Our theoretical discussion refers to tensions between democratic ideals and the effective organisation of stakeholder participation through representation, emphasising constraints on participation and what may be lost or gained through the selection processes that representation involves.

We also quantify relative contributions of socioeconomic factors to the US's GHG emission changes during 1995-2009 from both the consumption and supply sides, using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). Results show that income-based method can identify new critical sectors leading to GHG emissions (e.g., Renting of Machinery & Equipment and Other Business Activities and Financial Intermediation sectors) which are unidentifiable by production-based and consumption-based methods. Moreover, the supply side SDA reveals new factors for GHG emission changes: mainly production output structure representing product allocation pattern and primary input structure indicating sectoral shares in primary inputs. In addition to production-side and consumption-side GHG reduction measures, the U.S. should also pay attention to supply side measures such as influencing the behaviors of product allocation and primary inputs.","[""Business activities"",""Direct emissions"",""Primary inputs"",""Product allocations"",""Production outputs"",""Relative contribution"",""Socio-economic factor"",""Structural decomposition analysis (SDA)"",""Greenhouse Effect"",""United States""]",,10.1021/acs.est.6b00872,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84978832818,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/59841/1/manuscipt_1_revision_1_clean.pdf,0

With this aim, we carried out an extensive 3-year monitoring in ports and marinas along the coasts of both countries, which showed a widespread occurrence of both PPs, with Irgarol 1051 concentrations usually being lower than the Diuron ones. The measured concentrations were compared with regulatory Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) (Directive 2008/105/EC) and used to perform a probabilistic Ecological Risk Assessment (ERA), for a thorough evaluation of the potential adverse effects upon marine ecosystem. Irgarol 1051 amounts above the Annual Average Concentration (AA-EQS, 2.5 ng/L) were often detected in Apulia and, less frequently, in Albania. Moreover, in Apulia, sometimes the Maximum Allowable Concentrations (MAC-EQS, 16 ng/L) was exceeded. In Apulia, where levels exceeded MAC/AA-EQS, ERA found not negligible probabilities of exceeding the toxicity level (6–18 %). A less critical situation was observed for Diuron whose levels were always below the MAC-EQS (1800 ng/L) in both countries and, in Albania, also below the AA-EQS (200 ng/L).

A growing incidence of distal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas and increasing use of minimally invasive techniques have prompted interest in this procedure. The aim of this study was to assess short-term results of minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy (MIE-IL). Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed from June 2007 until September 2014, including patients that underwent MIE-IL for distal esophageal and gastroesophageal junction cancer in six different hospitals in the Netherlands and Spain. Data were collected with regard to operative techniques, pathology and postoperative complications. Results: In total, 282 patients underwent MIE-IL, of which 90.2 % received neoadjuvant therapy. Anastomotic leakage was observed in 43 patients (15.2 %), of whom 13 patients (4.6 %) had empyema, necessitating thoracotomy for decortication. With an aggressive treatment of complications, the 30-day and in-hospital mortality rate was 2.1 %. An R0-resection was obtained in 92.5 % of the patients. After neoadjuvant therapy, 20.1 % of patients had a complete response. Conclusions: Minimally invasive Ivor Lewis esophagectomy for distal esophageal and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinomas is an upcoming approach for reducing morbidity caused by laparotomy and thoracotomy. Anastomotic leakage rate is still high possibly due to technical diversity of anastomotic techniques, and a high percentage of patients treated by neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. An aggressive approach to complications leads to a low mortality of 2.1 %. Further improvement and standardization in the anastomotic technique are needed in order to perform a safe intrathoracic anastomosis.","[""Adenocarcinoma"",""Anastomosis, Surgical"",""Anastomotic Leak"",""Cohort Studies"",""Esophageal Neoplasms"",""Esophagectomy"",""Esophagogastric Junction"",""Female"",""Hospital Mortality"",""Humans"",""Intraoperative Complications"",""Laparoscopy"",""Lymph Node Excision"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Neoadjuvant Therapy"",""Netherlands"",""Postoperative Complications"",""Retrospective Studies"",""Spain"",""Thoracoscopy""]","[""Esophageal cancer"",""Esophagectomy"",""Intrathoracic anastomosis"",""Ivor Lewis"",""Minimally invasive""]",10.1007/s00464-016-4938-2,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84964607473,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00464-016-4938-2.pdf,0

Specific growth rates based on N2- and C-fixation were higher for cells of Dolichospermum spp. than for Aphanizomenon sp. and Nodularia spumigena. The cyanobacterial biomass, however, was dominated by Aphanizomenon sp., which contributed most to total N2-fixation in surface waters of the Northern Baltic Proper. N2-fixation by Pseudanabaena sp. and colonial picocyanobacteria was not detectable. N2-fixation by Aphanizomenon sp., Dolichospermum spp. and N. spumigena populations summed up to total N2-fixation, thus these genera appeared as sole diazotrophs within the Baltic Sea's euphotic zone, while their mean contribution to total C-fixation was 21%. Intriguingly, cell-specific N2-fixation was eightfold higher at a coastal station compared to an offshore station, revealing coastal zones as habitats with substantial N2-fixation. At the coastal station, the cell-specific C- to N2-fixation ratio was below the cellular C:N ratio, i.e. N2 was assimilated in excess to C-fixation, whereas the C- to N2-fixation ratio exceeded the C:N ratio in offshore sampled diazotrophs.

However, few studies have evaluated its impact on daily life or the perceived distress it can cause. Using a multi-methods approach, this study describes the impact and manifestations of fatigue in patients with IBS and investigates the relationship between fatigue severity and illness-related and health-promoting factors. Methods: A total of 160 patients with IBS completed self-reported questionnaires assessing fatigue, gastrointestinal symptoms, psychological distress, and sense of coherence. Fatigue was assessed with the Fatigue Impact Scale, which also includes structured and open-ended questions which were analyzed with a deductive qualitative analysis. Patients were classified as having severe, moderate, or mild fatigue based on frequency, distress and impact on daily life. Key Results: The open-ended questions revealed a multidimensional impact on life. Fatigue mainly interfered with the ability to perform physical activities, work, and domestic work, and the ability to interact socially. Decreased stamina was evident, along with strategies to limit the bodily consequences of tiredness. Severe fatigue was accompanied by more severe IBS symptoms, anxiety and depression and lower sense of coherence. Conclusions & Inferences: Fatigue is a distressing symptom which occurs in a sizeable proportion of patients with IBS. It affects life in a multidimensional way, with poor bodily stamina being the most prominent feature. Fatigue, along with sense of coherence, depression and anxiety, needs to be assessed, confirmed and targeted for interventions.","[""Adolescent"",""Adult"",""Cross-Sectional Studies"",""Fatigue"",""Female"",""Humans"",""Irritable Bowel Syndrome"",""Longitudinal Studies"",""Male"",""Middle Aged"",""Self Report"",""Surveys and Questionnaires"",""Young Adult""]","[""fatigue"",""irritable bowel syndrome"",""multi-methods""]",10.1111/nmo.12898,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84992646585,,0

However, its biological functions in marine organisms still represent a matter of debate. In sea urchins, the most accepted view is that ovothiol protects the eggs by the high oxidative burst at fertilization. In this work we address the role of ovothiol during sea urchin development to give new insights on ovothiol biosynthesis in metazoans. The gene involved in ovothiol biosynthesis OvoA was identified in Paracentrotus lividus genome (PlOvoA). PlOvoA embryo expression significantly increased at the pluteus stage and was up-regulated by metals at concentrations mimicking polluted sea-water and by cyclic toxic algal blooms, leading to ovothiol biosynthesis. In silico analyses of the PlOvoA upstream region revealed metal and stress responsive elements. Structural protein models highlighted conserved active site residues likely responsible for ovothiol biosynthesis. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that OvoA evolved in most marine metazoans and was lost in bony vertebrates during the transition from the aquatic to terrestrial environment. These results highlight the crucial role of OvoA in protecting embryos released in seawater from environmental cues, thus allowing the survival under different conditions.","[""Animals"",""Computer Simulation"",""Embryo, Nonmammalian"",""Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental"",""Metals"",""Methylhistidines"",""Paracentrotus"",""Peptide Synthases"",""Phylogeny"",""Protein Structure, Tertiary"",""Response Elements"",""Sequence Alignment"",""Stress, Physiological""]",,10.1038/srep21506,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84959441172,https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21506.pdf,0

This can be expected to affect Alpine lake ecosystems via, for example, intensified thermal stratification, shorter ice cover periods, and altered catchment processes. Our study assesses changes in some main constituents of the planktic and benthic communities of five mid-Alpine lakes in the Niedere Tauern region in Austria in relation to climatic warming, by comparing community and environmental data from 1998-1999 to data from 2010-2011. Although lake chemistry remained relatively stable between the study periods, we observed an increase in lake water temperatures and a decrease in ice cover durations. Several of the dominant diatom species and chrysophyte cyst types show relatively clear changes; the responses of the whole communities, however, are less evident. Yet, in particular, diatoms show distinct assemblage changes along the climatic gradients in the two lakes with the largest decrease in ice-cover duration. Chironomid communities appear to be less sensitive compared to diatoms and chrysophyte cysts, which are known for reacting quickly to changes in their environment. Finally, Alpine lakes, which are moderately nutrient-enriched because of human activities in the catchment area, are likely to experience increases in their productivity with climate warming.",,,10.1657/AAAR0015-058,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85009743303,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1657/AAAR0015-058?needAccess=true,0

Bilan 2 ans après sa mise en place,"© 2016 Elsevier Masson SASRepeating evaluations of vaccine coverage (VC) is essential to measure the implementation and effectiveness of vaccination policy. We report the results of VC in infants from the Vaccinoscopie® study in 2014 to assess the changes secondary to the new 2013 immunization schedule. Method Study conducted on Internet among a representative sample of mothers reporting their child's vaccination record. Results The removal of the dose of DTPa-Hib at the age of 3 months was quickly adopted since only 1 % of children aged 6 months had received three doses of DTPa in 2014 compared to 96 % in 2012. The booster dose is administered earlier for the DTPa and hepatitis B components. The shift of MMR vaccination from 9 months of age for children participating in community structures to 12 months for all children was closely followed since only 2 % of 9- to 11-month-old children received a MMR vaccine in 2014 compared to 33 % in 2012. The second dose of MMR recommended at 16–18 months of age rather than between 13 and 24 months was actually followed by an earlier administration of this dose. At 18–20 months of age, 60 % received two doses of MMR in 2014 versus 41 % in 2012. Finally, for meningitis C vaccination, a significant increase of VC was observed in children 15–23 months of age (66 % in 2014 versus 44 % in 2012).

Whether the toxic effects of AgNP towards freshwater organisms are fully explainable by the release of ionic silver (Ag+) has not been conclusively elucidated. Long-term effects to benthic microbial communities (periphyton) that provide essential functions in stream ecosystems are unknown. The effects of exposure of periphyton to 2 and 20 μg/L Ag+ (AgNO3) and AgNP (polyvinylpyrrolidone stabilised) were investigated in artificial indoor streams. The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and 3D biofilm structure, biomass, algae species, Ag concentrations in the water phase and bioassociated Ag were analysed. A strong decrease in total Ag was observed within 4 days. Bioassociated Ag was proportional to dissolved Ag indicating a rate limitation by diffusion across the diffusive boundary layer. Two micrograms per liter of AgNO3 or AgNP did not induce significant effects despite detectable bioassociation of Ag. The 20-μg/L AgNO3 affected green algae and diatom communities, biomass and the ratio of polysaccharides to proteins in EPS. The 20-μg/L AgNO3 and AgNP decreased biofilm volume to about 50 %, while the decrease of biomass was lower in 20 μg/L AgNP samples than the 20-μg/L AgNO3 indicating a compaction of the NP-exposed biofilms. Roughness coefficients were lower in 20 μg/L AgNP-treated samples.

Sustainable development is generally recognised as having a three-lens approach: development must balance impacts in the economic, environmental and cultural dimensions. While cultural themes such as governance, motivation, and social values are widely acknowledged in the literature as critical for transformations to sustainability, however, research on these themes has been scant. Culture influences many aspects of society; hence it is important to consider culture when developing policies for sustainable development. Understanding national cultures can lead to greater understanding of what shapes national policy and strategies for transformations to sustainable energy systems. Understanding cultural influences on policy can help other countries to overcome similar challenges in policy making, planning or local resource management. Comparisons between countries serve to further advance the understanding of approaches to such challenges. This paper examines transformations towards sustainable energy through the lens of culture, through a case study of geothermal development in Iceland and Japan. Using Hoftsede's cultural theory framework, we highlight cultural variables relevant to sustainability transformations, with particular emphasis on the challenges of the management of geothermal energy resources, and the management of related conflicts and public participation. We present our findings garnered from interviews with key players in the energy industry in both countries reinforced by an extensive literature review. We find that culture clearly influences the approach to geothermal energy development in both countries and we identify benefits and disadvantages to approaches on overlapping issues and challenges in both countries.","[""Cultural characteristics"",""Cultural influences"",""Geothermal development"",""Issues and challenges"",""Public participation"",""Sustainable energy"",""Sustainable energy development"",""Sustainable energy systems""]","[""Cultural characteristics"",""Geothermal energy"",""Sustainable energy"",""Transformations to sustainability""]",10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.029,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019924023,http://pure.iiasa.ac.at/id/eprint/14611/1/GeothermalCulture%208%20final%20submision%20%281%29.docx,0

This study was established to determine the feasibility and impact of decentralizing comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care (CEmONC) services in underserved rural areas using associate clinicians. Methods Ten health centres (HCs) were upgraded by constructing and equipping maternity blocks, operating rooms, laboratories, staff houses and installing solar panels, standby generators and water supply systems. Twenty-three assistant medical officers (advanced level associate clinicians), and forty-four nurse-midwives and clinical officers (associate clinicians) were trained in CEmONC and anaesthesia respectively. CEmONC services were launched between 2009 and 2012. Monthly supportive supervision and clinical audits of adverse pregnancy outcomes were introduced in 2011 in these HCs and their respective district hospitals. Findings After launching CEmONC services from 2009 to 2014 institutional deliveries increased in all upgraded rural HCs. Mean numbers of monthly deliveries increased by 151% and obstetric referrals decreased from 9% to 3% (p = 0.03) in HCs. A total of 43,846 deliveries and 2,890 caesarean sections (CS) were performed in these HCs making the mean proportion of all births in EmONC facilities of 128% and mean population-based CS rate of 9%. There were 190 maternal deaths and 1,198 intrapartum and very early neonatal deaths (IVEND) in all health facilities. Generally, health centres had statistically significantly lower maternal mortality ratios and IVEND rates than district hospitals (p < 0.00 and < 0.02 respectively). Of all deaths (maternal and IVEND) 84% to 96% were considered avoidable.

In this article, we investigate the effects of naturalness, gender, and age on the activities, aesthetics, and self-reported well-being associated with urban green space. Our findings are based on a postal survey of residents living in close proximity to six different green spaces in the city of Gothenburg, Sweden. It is shown that higher perceived naturalness generated more activities and higher aesthetic values and self-reported well-being for residents living close to urban green spaces. The results also indicated that, regardless of the type of naturalness, women were more active in urban green spaces than were men. Women also saw greater aesthetic value in green spaces than men did, and had higher self-reported well-being associated with the urban green spaces. Finally, older residents were shown to participate in a greater number of nature-related activities than younger residents. Older residents also saw greater aesthetic values and had higher self-reported well-being associated with urban green spaces than younger people did. Seemingly, this poses a considerable planning challenge if areas of perceived naturalness are to be retained in cities, since the present trend is for reduced green spaces in cities and a ‘parkification’ of surviving natural areas.

To meet this challenge, several permeable and ""structural"" or ""skeletal soils"" have been developed as alternatives to the typical compacted soil required to bear the weight of vehicular traffic in urban areas. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the resistance to permanent deformation of permeable and skeletal soil pavement structures based on full scale accelerated pavement tests (APT) using a heavy vehicle simulator (HVS). Interlocking paving stones of various types were used as permeable surface layer for the test structures. The results demonstrated that the permeable test structures exhibited higher permanent deformation than the corresponding impervious structures. The skeletal soil with bituminous base layer, however, produced performance comparable to the impervious reference test structures.","[""Heavy vehicle simulators"",""Life expectancies"",""Pavement structures"",""Pavement systems"",""Permanent deformations"",""Permeable pavements"",""Permeable surface"",""Test structure""]","[""Block pavement"",""Heavy vehicle simulator"",""Permeable pavement"",""Skeletal soil""]",10.1007/978-3-319-42797-3_9,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85026703252,,0

However, the causal connection between myocardial infarctions and atherosclerotic plaque rupture events in the coronary arteries has not been investigated so far. The objective of this study was to assess whether diet-induced coronary plaque ruptures trigger atherothrombotic occlusions, resulting in myocardial infarctions in HFC-fed HypoE/SRBI-/- mice. Methods: HypoE/SRBI-/- mice were characterized with respect to the individual dynamics of myocardial infarctions and features of infarct-related coronary atherosclerosis by serial noninvasive molecular and functional imaging, histopathology, and a pharmaceutical intervention. Detailed histologic analysis of whole mouse hearts was performed when spontaneously occurring acute myocardial infarctions were diagnosed by imaging. Results: Using the imaging-Triggered approach, we discovered thrombi in 32 (10.8%) of all 296 atherosclerotic coronary plaques in 14 HFC-fed HypoE/SRBI-/- mice. These thrombi typically were found in arteries presenting with inflammatory plaque phenotypes. Acetylsalicylic acid treatment did not attenuate the development of atherosclerotic coronary plaques but profoundly reduced the incidence of premature deaths, the number of thrombi (7 in 249 plaques), and also the degree of inflammation in the culprit lesions. Conclusion: HFC-induced ruptures of coronary plaques trigger atherothrombosis, vessel occlusions, myocardial infarctions, and sudden death in these mice. Thus, the HypoE/SRBI-/- mouse model mimics major features of human coronary heart disease and might therefore be a valuable model for the investigation of molecular and cellular parameters driving plaque rupture-related events and the development of new interventional approaches.","[""Animals"",""Coronary Thrombosis"",""Diagnostic Imaging"",""Female"",""Male"",""Mice"",""Mice, Knockout"",""Myocardial Infarction"",""Plaque, Atherosclerotic"",""Rupture, Spontaneous""]","[""Aspirin"",""Atherosclerosis"",""Hyperlipidemicmouse model"",""Imaging"",""Plaque vulnerability"",""Thrombosis""]",10.2967/jnumed.115.171132,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989298240,http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/57/9/1420.full.pdf,0

It followed that some of them are still important chemical contaminants. Concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) are hazardous for the consumer health; those of the 6 indicator polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are often close to the current European maximum residue limit and always higher than the former limit. The relationship between OC concentrations, biometric parameters and the lipid content was then investigated. A strong positive correlation with eel size emerged for the indicator PCBs and DDTs concentrations expressed on wet weight basis. This is explained by the corresponding higher lipid percentage that characterizes bigger eels and the absence of a dilution effect for compounds of main concerns. On the basis of the PCB-TDI threshold for a 70 kg person, we suggest that 1 should consume no more than 2 eels per week each weighing about 100 g. Thus, we conclude that eel consumption should be limited and restricted to eels relatively shorter and lighter.","[""Adipose Tissue"",""Anguilla"",""Animals"",""Body Composition"",""Body Weight"",""Diet"",""Ethylene Dichlorides"",""Food Contamination"",""Food Safety"",""Humans"",""Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated"",""Italy"",""Polychlorinated Biphenyls"",""Risk Assessment"",""Seafood"",""Water Pollutants, Chemical""]","[""Biometric parameters"",""European eel"",""Human health risk"",""Lipid content"",""Organochlorine pesticides"",""Polychlorinated biphenyls""]",10.1111/1750-3841.13259,https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84960146160,,0
